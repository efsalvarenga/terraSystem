## Other Credit Due 

This work is also inspired in several other games for it's sub-systems. Namely:

- The simplicity is inspired by [*World of Dungeons*](https://johnharper.itch.io/world-of-dungeons) by John Harper.
- *Ego* usage is inspired by [Trophy](https://trophyrpg.com/), product of Jesse Ross and Hedgemaze Press.
- *Precision* and *Effect* of a *Risky Action* evaluated with one single roll is inspired by [*Best Left Buried Zine Edition*](https://soulmuppet-store.co.uk/products/best-left-buried-zini-edition) by Zachary Cox and Nicholas Spence.

# Design Principles

Terra System's mechanics were designed as they are with the following set of principles in mind.

- Collaborative narrative between GM and Players, with story meta currency (*Ego*). The meta currency is generic enough to be adapted for different game themes (e.g. panic, mutation, corruption).
- Unified mechanics for all kinds of actions: combat, travel or persuasion are executed similarly, for example.
- Partial successes.
- Gambling: *Ego* usage and recovery
- Simple statblocks for *Challenges*: enemies, journeys, etc.
- Double duty rolls: one single roll defines precision, effect and presence of any consequence of an action.
- Character development mechanics includes positive and negative aspects.
- Players can decide how fast they ride their characters, but faster progression comes with a cost.
- Character survivability includes body and mental aspects.
- Black swan effects are possible (e.g. a hobbit might just kill a dragon in one single blow).
- No difficulty class setting, but different levels of consequence of failures - that are explicit.
- Optional skills, if game of interests would benefit from detailed character's expertises.
