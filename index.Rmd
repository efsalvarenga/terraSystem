# Introduction {-}

![](imgs/TerranEngineCover.png)

The [**Terra System**](https://efsalvarenga.github.io/terraSystem/) is a rules light tabletop role playing system focused on narrative, player agency and consequences. Only 6-sided dice are used, in two tones: **Light Dice** and **Dark Dice**. A character sheet is available for [**download**](assets/TerranSheet.pdf), but any piece of paper is enough to play. You will also need some pencils and friends.
