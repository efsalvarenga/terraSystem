[["index.html", "Terra System Introduction", " Terra System Introduction The Terra System is a rules light tabletop role playing system focused on narrative, player agency and consequences. Only 6-sided dice are used, in two tones: Light Dice and Dark Dice. A character sheet is available for download, but any piece of paper is enough to play. You will also need some pencils and friends. "],["srd.html", "Section 1 System Reference v0.6.1 1.1 Characters 1.2 Rules", " Section 1 System Reference v0.6.1 Taxonomy “You” and “Your” are used interchangeably to refer to players and their characters. For disambiguation “Player(s)” is used when referring to the player outside the context of their character. “Challenge” is used to represent anything that is antagonistic to you, be that an NPC, the environment, etc. Meta game concepts, stats and currencies are marked as italic. Book references are marked in code, they might be accompanied by page ranges. 1.1 Characters With the other players, define a cohesive group concept. Always start with a Name and Archetype. Roll for Attributes and assign points. Roll for Grit and Ego. Choose one Advancement. A character sheet is available here. 1.1.1 Archetypes You are defined by an Archetype, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative. Each Archetype should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial Archetypes towards unique narratives. Hero: Embodies courage and strength, often the protagonist fighting against the odds. Mentor: Provides guidance and wisdom, helping the hero on their journey. Everyman: Represents the common man, relatability and realism. Innocent: Embodies purity, optimism, and faith. Ruler: Exudes control, responsibility, and sovereignty. Sage: Seeks truth, knowledge, and wisdom. Explorer: Loves discovering new worlds, autonomy, and the freedom to find out who they are through exploration. Outlaw: Represents rebellion, breaking the rules, and fighting against the status quo. Magician: Transforms reality, embodies vision and imagination. Lover: Pursues connection, romance, and passion. Jester: Values joy, humor, and light-heartedness. Caregiver: Provides nurture, generosity, and compassion. 1.1.2 Attributes There are \\(6\\) Attributes that you can use to overcome obstacles. Intuition: track targets, understand creatures, care, survive. Reason: concentrate, think abstractly, build knowledge. Finesse: dextrous manipulation, precision, subtle misdirection. Exertion: apply physical force and power, melee. Attunement: get in the flow and tune the arcane or technology. Influence: compel obedience, socialise, influence. Each Attribute has a rating (from \\(0\\) to \\(4\\)) that determine how many dice to roll when performing Risky Actions. On the character sheet, their ratings are read horizontally. Saves are groupings of two Attributes each. Insight/Reflexes Save groups Intuition and Reason Attributes Prowess/Fortitude Save groups Finesse and Exertion Attributes Resolve/Willpower Save groups Attunement and Influence Attributes Saves also have ratings (from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\)) that determine how many dice to roll in a Reaction situation. On the character sheet, their ratings are read vertically. Determine ratings For each Save grouping (Insight, Prowess, and Resolve) roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below to determine how many rating points you have to distribute for each. \\(1:3\\) \\(4:5\\) \\(6\\) Attribute points \\(1\\) \\(2\\) \\(3\\) In certain conditions, you might permanently lose ratings, this is discussed in other sections. Example: Scuff’s ratings Scuff has an Attunement Attribute rating of \\(3\\) (read horizontally). They roll \\(3d\\) when performing a Risky Action related to Attunement. They also have Influence \\(0\\) (horizontally), so they roll \\(0d\\) (i.e. no chance if no advantage is found). If their Resolve is challenged, they may roll a Reaction with \\(1d\\), based on their Resolve/Willpower Save rating (read vertically). 1.1.3 Skills Roll \\(2d\\), and consult the result on the column and row. You get one skill of your choice from the group you rolled. Roll as many times as you have points. \\(1:2\\) \\(3:4\\) \\(5:6\\) \\(1:2\\) AdministrationLaw, Business, Investigation, Trading, Negotiation CulturesReligion, Arts, Alien, Streetwise, Spacers, World (specify), Language (specify) LiaisonLeadership, Persuasion, Connections, Empathy, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Seduction \\(3:4\\) AthleticsSpeed, Acrobatics, Throwing, Strength, Endurance, Zero-G ViolenceEnergy projectiles, Small guns, Primitive projectiles, Long range weapons, Mount gunnery, Bludgeoning, Slashing, Piercing, Unarmed SurvivalSneak, Orientation, Forage, Tame, Crafting, Tactics, Vigilance \\(5:6\\) TechnologyAstronautics, Medical, Computers, Machinery, Explosives, Robotics, Battledress, Electronics VehiclesAircraft, Civilian land craft, Military land craft, Spacecrafts, Watercraft SciencesGeology, Ecology, Psychology, History, Medicine, Linguistics, Chemistry, Archaeology It is assumed you are always honing your skills and learning new ones. It takes 2 years and material costs to develop a new skill while you take your normal day-to-day activities. Determine ratings Roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below to determine how many rating points you have to distribute for each. \\(1:3\\) \\(4:5\\) \\(6\\) Skill points \\(4\\) \\(5\\) \\(6\\) 1.1.4 Grit &amp; Ego “It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward” (Rocky Balboa) While Grit represents your disposition, Ego represents your resilience to keep pushing. Roll \\(1d\\) to determine your Grit and Ego. Advancements and conditions may change the number of dice you roll. Wounds You lose Grit when you are harmed. When your Grit reaches \\(0\\) you start marking Wound tracks. You have \\(3\\) Wound tracks: Stressed (\\(-1d\\) Insight), Broken (\\(-1d\\) Prowess) and Weary (\\(-1d\\) Resolve). When all three Wound tracks are marked, you become Mortally Wounded. While Mortally Wounded you cannot gather Light Die for your Risky Actions. You will die instantly if harmed further, or in minutes if not attended to. If you survive being Mortally Wounded, you develop a Malaise. Roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below. With the GM, describe it narratively. Malaises \\(1\\) No Malaise. \\(2\\) \\(-1\\) Prowess, you die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(3\\) \\(-1\\) Insight, you die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(4\\) \\(-1\\) Resolve, you die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(5\\) When you re-roll your Ego, use \\(-1d\\) from now on. You die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(6\\) Re-roll your Grit with \\(-1d\\) from now on. You die if it goes below \\(0d\\). After a well fed and rested night, you roll and reset your Grit (\\(1d\\)). If you did not rest well you have \\(-1d\\) to roll for Grit. Each Wound track recovers through appropriate care and a week of rest. A Malaise never recovers. Pushing yourself You spend Ego when you push beyond yourself in Risky Actions. When your Ego reaches \\(0\\) you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. Any time you Fail in a Risky Action you may choose to suffer a Panic Event. When you do so, roll your Ego die (\\(1d\\)) and consult the table below. Outcome \\(1:3\\) Reset your Ego to \\(1:3\\). You Flight, compelled to leave the scene. \\(4:5\\) Reset your Ego to \\(4:5\\). You Freeze, silently or otherwise. \\(6\\) Reset your Ego to \\(6\\). You Fight, obsessed with being successful during the scene. Describe the outcome narrativelly. In any case, after the scene ends, you gain a Condition. With the GM, determine the mechanical effects and how to introduce your Condition into the narrative. Example: Scuff’s scuffs Scuff has \\(1d\\) for both Grit and Ego (usual for early characters). They have seen some harm, having lost \\(3\\) Grit (from \\(5\\) to \\(2\\)) and taken a Hazed wound. This means that any time they roll related to Insight (Intuition or Reason for Risky Actions, or Evasion Reaction), they take \\(-1d\\). Scuff also risked their Ego a few times, and took a Condition to reset it (from 2 to 4). Finally, they have gotten a malaise at some point, having reduced their Exertion Attribute rating because of a weakened lower back. 1.1.5 Advancements As you become more seasoned, you gain Advancements. You start the game with \\(1\\) Advancement. The list below are examples of a simple framework for their in-game mechanics. For every session you play (and survive) you gain \\(+2\\) Experience. You also gain \\(+1\\) Experience for each new Condition you develop. Whenever it is narratively coherent, you may spend Experience equal to \\(2\\times\\) your current number of Advancements to gain a new one. Asceticism You do not take \\(-1d\\) when rolling for Grit while poorly fed. Assassin \\(+2d\\) when trying to assassinate an unaware rival. Bodyguard You can choose to take damage instead of one of your allies. Could be worse When Broken you do not take the penalty of \\(-1d\\). Danger sense \\(+1d\\) whenever you use a Insight/Evasion Save. Developed Gain \\(1\\) in an Attribute. The maximum you can have in all Attributes together is \\(10\\). Die Hard When you reset your Grit, roll \\(+1d\\) and sum all the dice you rolled. Dodger Unarmed or primitive weapons cannot hit you. Eager When you reset your Ego, roll \\(+1d\\) and keep the highest. Expert You have \\(3\\) additional skill points. This is only available during character creation. Fast When you roll, your Effect is always applied first. Healer You can automatically stabilise a Mortally Wounded ally. Henchkeeper You automatically succeed acquiring non-combatant henchmen in a community. Ironhide When unarmoured, your Armour is \\(1\\). Sensory acuity You have \\(+1d\\) on noticing things through a chosen sense. Sleek \\(+1d\\) whenever you contort yourself to to break free. Spacefarer You automatically succeed in piloting Challenges up to \\(3d\\). Martial combatant Unarmed attacks are not considered improvised, and are \\(+1e\\) Unyielding When Weary you do not take the penalty of \\(-1d\\). Whirlwind In melee combat, when you are successful, select an additional die as a second effect. 1.1.6 Conditions Conditions are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative. The list below can be used as a starting point. With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones. Fear-Driven Vigilance: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you have \\(-1d\\) Obsessive Focus: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Gain \\(+1\\) Point in one Skill and \\(-1\\) Point in two other Skills. Moral Reservations: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Actions that go against your moral code have \\(-1d\\). Compulsive Honesty: You vow to always speak the truth. Kleptomaniac: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don’t really need. Battle-Scarred: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically, intellectually or socially. Protective Instinct: You are genuinely concerned with your team’s welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you have \\(-1d\\). Estranged: You lose the bond with someone you love or cherish. With the GM, agree the mechanical impact. Slow: When you roll, your Effect is always applied last. 1.1.7 Equipment With the GM define which tags, ranges and Effect are appropriate for your weapons. Weapons used outside their expected ranges roll with \\(-1d\\). The following short list of tags may be expanded with the GM. Versatile: \\(+1e\\) when held two-handed. Nimble: Effect is applied first. Slaughter: Effect die explode on \\(5+\\). Improvised: \\(-1d\\), \\(-1e\\). Unhandy: \\(-1d\\) if used at Contact or Reach ranges. Weapon Effect Ranges Tags Knife \\(\\pm 0e\\) Contact Nimble Staff \\(\\pm 0e\\) Contact - Primitive bow \\(+1e\\) Short Unhandy Short sword \\(+1e\\) Contact Versatile Long sword \\(+2e\\) Contact Versatile Hunting rifle \\(+3e\\) Short; Long - Armours act as buffers when you take damage from Challenges. Subtract the armour modifier from the Effect before reducing your Grit Armour Modifier Details Light \\(-1e\\) Heavy \\(-2e\\) \\(-1d\\) to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. Shield \\(-1e\\) Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an Effect. 1.2 Rules 1.2.1 Risky Actions When you are trying your chances at a Risky Action, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate Attribute or Save. Then gather 6-sided dice. Dice Pool Take a number of Light Dice equal to your applicable Attribute or Save. Add \\(1d\\) if you have an appropriate Skill. If you are in an advantageous or precarious position, or if your Advancements are relevant, you may have \\(\\pm d\\). You must always roll between \\(0d\\) and \\(4d\\) Light Dice. Take as many Dark Dice as you wish to risk Ego for pushing yourself for a success. For each Dark Die that rolls equal or lower than your current Ego, decrease your Ego in one. Roll the dice and choose one die to be your Precision (generally the highest, but you might choose differently if you wish) and consult the table. Outcome \\(1:3\\) You Fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe the consequences. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. \\(4:5\\) You Succeed, but there’s some consequences. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed. \\(6\\) You Succeed. With the GM describe what happens. Evaluate Effects as appropriate, if the Risky Action is part of a Challenge. Effects Effects determines the quantitative result of your Risky Actions towards overcoming Challenges. Examples of Effects are: Damage given, Convincing done, Distance covered, Weakness learned. When you roll your Risky Actions, choose one die to be your Effect (generally the second highest, if the highest was used as Precision). The Effect die is an exploding die (i.e. if the result is a \\(6\\), keep rolling and accumulating the result). The Effect you apply is never lower than the Effect Tier of your approach, regardless of the die outcome. Your Effect is subtracted from the Challenge Disposition. Examples \\(-1e\\)Bad Improvised tool;Rock, pipe, punch. \\(\\pm0e\\)Mediocre Primitive tool;Weak argument;Knife, staff. \\(+1e\\)Good Fit for purpose tool;Good argument; Revolver, one-handed sword. \\(+2e\\)Better Expert grade tool;Strong rationale;Autofire pistol, SMG, two-handed sword \\(+3e\\)Best Tech augmented expert grade tool;Rifle, shotgun, large axe and bastard sword Challenges Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome Challenges. Examples of Challenges are fighting an enemy, duelling rhetorically, negotiating an environment, crawling a location, journeying. Challenges have a descriptive Name. Challenges are divided in Tiers, which define how much Effect they take to be overcame (Disposition), and how many Effect dice they use (Severity). Tier Examples Trivial \\(5\\)\\(d/2\\) Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey Dangerous \\(10\\)\\(1d\\) Skilled adversaries, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey Serious \\(20\\)\\(2d\\) Expert adversaries, large predator, traverse fire or acid Formidable \\(30\\)\\(3d\\) Human prime, apex predator, climbing the Everest Exceptional \\(40+\\)\\(4d+\\) Transhuman, often fatal environments, heroic journeys Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous Challenge to fight against, but a Trivial Challenge to be convinced to ignore you. When Challenge Effects are applied to you narratively, use the table. Consequence \\(1:3\\) Something annoying happens. \\(4:5\\) Something troublesome happens. \\(6\\) Something devastating happens. When Challenge Effects are applied to you as damage your Grit might be reduced. Subtract the armour rating from the Effect, and then reduce the remainder from your Grit. 1.2.2 Fortune die When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll \\(1d\\). 1.2.3 Sayonara At any moment you can decide it is your last scene. When you do that, re-roll your Ego and Grit, and keep the highest values. For this scene, you only expend Ego if you roll a \\(1\\). By the end of the scene, you have to figure out how you depart (death, madness, mission, etc.). You can create a new character with half (rounded up) the number of Advances the previous character had. "],["making-a-game.html", "Section 2 Making a Game 2.1 Ego in Pulp Fantasy 2.2 Examples", " Section 2 Making a Game Terran Engine is focuses on the grimdark aesthetics, which might not be the thematic choice of every game. By adapting the Archetypes and Advancements, and reskinning Ego (and Conditions), other genres can easily be emulated. A few playtested examples are given. The Rules section can mostly be used as is. 2.1 Ego in Pulp Fantasy For the Pulp Fantasy genre, Ego can be used as a measure of how far the next climax is. Whenever relevant, the GM rolls one die. If the die is higher than the highest Ego of the Party, a climax event happens. After this climax, all Ego is restored to its original max.

"],["design-principles.html", "B Design Principles", " B Design Principles Terran Engine’s mechanics were designed as they are with the following set of principles in mind. Collaborative narrative between GM and Players. Unified mechanics for all kinds of actions: combat, travel or persuasion are executed similarly, for example. Partial successes. Gambling: Ego usage, Ego recovery, Grit avoidance with ailments. Simple statblocks for Challenges: enemies, journeys, etc. Double duty rolls: one single roll defines precision, effect and presence of any consequence of an action. Character development mechanics includes positive and negative aspects. Players can decide how fast they ride their characters, but faster progression comes with a cost. Character survivability includes body and mental resistance. Black swan effects are possible (e.g. a hobbit might just kill a dragon in one single blow). No difficulty class setting, but different levels of consequence of failures - that are explicit.
