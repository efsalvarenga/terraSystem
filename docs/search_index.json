[["index.html", "Terran Engine Terran Engine SRD v0.5.1 Taxonomy", " Terran Engine Terran Engine SRD v0.5.1 Terran Engine is a rules light tabletop roleplaying system focused on narrative, player agency and consequences. Only 6-sided dice are used, in two tones: Light Dice and Dark Dice. A character sheet is available for download, but any piece of paper is enough to play. You will also need some pencils and friends. Taxonomy “You” and “Your” are used interchangeably to refer to players and their characters. For disambiguation “Player(s)” is used when referring to the player outside the context of their character. “Challenge” is used to represent anything that is antagonistic to you, be that an NPC, the environment, etc. Meta game concepts, stats and currencies are marked as italic. Book references are marked in code, they might be accompanied by page ranges. "],["characters.html", "Section 1 Characters 1.1 Archetypes 1.2 Skills &amp; Attributes 1.3 Grit &amp; Ego 1.4 Advancements 1.5 Conditions 1.6 Equipment", " Section 1 Characters With the other players, define a cohesive group concept. Always start with a Name and an Archetype. Roll for Attributes and assign Skills Roll for Grit and Ego. Optional: Choose one Advancement. A character sheet is available here. 1.1 Archetypes You are defined by an Archetype, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative. Each Archetype should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial Archetypes towards unique narratives. Hero: Embodies courage and strength, often the protagonist fighting against the odds. Mentor: Provides guidance and wisdom, helping the hero on their journey. Everyman: Represents the common man, relatability and realism. Innocent: Embodies purity, optimism, and faith. Ruler: Exudes control, responsibility, and sovereignty. Sage: Seeks truth, knowledge, and wisdom. Explorer: Loves discovering new worlds, autonomy, and the freedom to find out who they are through exploration. Outlaw: Represents rebellion, breaking the rules, and fighting against the status quo. Magician: Transforms reality, embodies vision and imagination. Lover: Pursues connection, romance, and passion. Jester: Values joy, humor, and light-heartedness. Caregiver: Provides nurture, generosity, and compassion. 1.2 Skills &amp; Attributes There are \\(6\\) Skills that you can use to overcome obstacles. Intuition: track targets, understand creatures, care, survive. Reason: concentrate, think abstractly, build knowledge. Finesse: dextrous manipulation, precision, subtle misdirection. Exertion: apply physical force and power, melee. Attunement: get in the flow and tune the arcane or technology. Influence: compel obedience, socialise, influence. Each Skill has a rating (from \\(0\\) to \\(4\\)) that determine how many dice to roll when performing Risky Actions. There is a limit for Skills rated above \\(2\\). This limit may be derived from your Archetype. \\[ \\begin{split} Skill &gt; 2 = \\begin{cases} 3 \\text{ rated at } 3 \\\\ 1 \\text{ rated at } 4 ; 1 \\text{ rated at } 3 \\end{cases} \\end{split} \\] Attributes are groupings of two Skills each. Attributes also have ratings (from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\)) that determine how many dice to roll when facing a Risky Action passively (Save). Insight Skills: Intuition, Reason Saves: Perception &amp; Awareness Prowess Skills: Finesse, Exertion Saves: Fortitude &amp; Reflexes Resolve Skills: Attunement, Influence Saves: Sanity, Stress &amp; Courage For each Attribute (Prowess, Sagacity and Resolve) roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below to determine how many points you have to distribute to their Skills. \\(1:3\\) \\(4:5\\) \\(6\\) Points \\(1\\) \\(2\\) \\(3\\) In certain conditions, you might permanently lose Attribute points. 1.3 Grit &amp; Ego “It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward” (Rocky Balboa) While Grit represents your physical disposition, Ego represents your resilience. Roll \\(1d\\) to determine your initial Grit maximum and initial Ego. Advancements and conditions may change these numbers. After a well fed and rested night, you recover \\(1d\\) of Grit lost. At any moment, you may choose to take a Condition and roll \\(1d\\) to reset your Ego. You lose Grit when you are physically harmed. When your Grit reaches \\(0\\) you become wounded. You have \\(3\\) Wound tracks. You choose what they mean narratively. Beyond those, you are mortally wounded and will die if harmed. You spend Ego when you push beyond yourself in Risky Actions or use some character Advancements. When your Ego reaches \\(0\\) you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. 1.4 Advancements Advancements can have any narrative reasoning you want. The list below are examples of a simple framework for their in-game mechanics: Eager: When you reset your Ego, roll \\(+1d\\) and keep the highest. Die Hard: Roll your Grit maximum with \\(+1d\\). You can choose to keep this new maximum if it is higher than your current maximum. Skill: Gain \\(1\\) in a Skill. Specialist: Choose a specific type of action. Risky Actions are done with \\(+1d\\) with this specialisation. For a list of specialisations, check Cepheus SRD’s skill list. Buff or Debuff: Roll a Resolve Skill and Dark Dice. Apply your Effect as a Buff or Debuff consequence. You may divide the result in as many targets as you want. You can take this Advancement multiple times if you want to Buff and Debuff with different Resolve Skills. Heal or Hurt: Roll an Insight Skill and Dark Dice. Multiply your Effect by the number of Ego spent and use the result to Heal or Hurt. You may divide the result in as many targets as you want. You can take this Advancement multiple times if you want to Heal or Hurt with different Insight Skills. Tough: When unarmoured your Armour is \\(1\\). Bodyguard: You can choose to take damage instead of one of your allies. Sensory acuity: You have \\(+1d\\) on noticing things through a chosen sense. Whirlwind: In combat, roll a Prowess Skill and Dark Dice. If you are successful, deal one additional instance of Effect to a Challenge at range. Retire: With the GM decide how your story ends. Create a new character with half (rounded up) the number of Advancements you have now, including this one. Fast: When you roll, your Effect is always applied first. 1.5 Conditions At any moment in the game you can re-roll your Ego by taking a Condition. The recovery of your inner strength often comes through confronting, enduring, and adapting to hardship. These trials teach you to integrate the traumas that permanently transform your self, strengthening your resilience. With the GM, determine the new Condition you have, and how to introduce it into the narrative. Conditions are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative. The list below can be used as a starting point. With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones. Fear-Driven Vigilance: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you have \\(-1d\\) Obsessive Focus: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Gain \\(+1\\) Point in one Skill and \\(-1\\) Point in two other Skills. Inept: For some reason you are always inept in a specific type of action. Risky Actions are done with \\(-1d\\) with this specialisation. For a list of specialisations, check Cepheus SRD’s skill list Moral Reservations: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Actions that go against your moral code have \\(-1d\\). Compulsive Honesty: You vow to always speak the truth. Kleptomaniac: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don’t really need. Battle-Scarred: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically, intellectually or socially. Protective Instinct: You are genuinely concerned with your team’s welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you have \\(-1d\\). Estranged: You lose the bond with someone you love or cherish. With the GM, agree the mechanical impact. Slow: When you roll, your Effect is always applied last. 1.6 Equipment With the GM define which tags, ranges and Effect are appropriate for your weapons. Weapons used outside their expected ranges roll with \\(-1d\\). The following short list of tags may be expanded with the GM. Versatile: \\(+1e\\) when held two-handed. Nimble: Effect is applied first Slaughter: Effect die explode on \\(5+\\) Armours act as buffers when you take damage from Challenges. Subtract the armour modifier from the Effect before reducing your Grit Armour Modifier Details Light \\(-1\\) Heavy \\(-2\\) \\(-1d\\) to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. Shield \\(-1\\) Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an Effect. "],["rules.html", "Section 2 Rules 2.1 Risky Actions 2.2 Effects 2.3 Challenges 2.4 Wounds 2.5 Experience 2.6 Fortune die", " Section 2 Rules 2.1 Risky Actions When you are trying your chances at a Risky Action, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate Attribute or Skill. Then gather 6-sided dice. Dice Pool Take a number of Light Dice equal to your applicable Attribute or Skill. If you are in an advantageous or precarious position, the GM may give you \\(\\pm 1d\\). You must always have between \\(0\\) and \\(4\\) Light Dice. Take as many Dark Dice as you wish to risk Ego for pushing yourself for a success. For each Dark Dice that rolls equal or lower than your current Ego, decrease your Ego in one. Roll the dice and choose one die to be your Precision (generally the highest, but you might choose differently if you wish) and consult the table. Outcome \\(1:3\\) You fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe the consequences. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. \\(4:5\\) You succeed, but there’s some consequences. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed. \\(6\\) You succeed. With the GM describe what happens. Evaluate Effects as appropriate, if the Risky Action is part of a Challenge, 2.2 Effects Effects determines the quantitative result of your Risky Actions towards overcoming Challenges. Examples of Effects are: Damage given, Convincing done, Distance covered, Weakness learned. When you roll your Risky Actions, choose one die to be your Effect (generally the second highest, if the highest was used as Precision). The Effect die is an exploding die (i.e. if the result is a \\(6\\), keep rolling and accumulating the result). The Effect you apply is never lower than the Effect level of your approach, regardless of the die outcome. Consult the table below. Effect Level Examples Improvised \\(1e\\) Makeshift tool;Rock, pipe, punch. Weak \\(2e\\) Primitive tool;Weak argumentKnife, staff Standard \\(3e\\) Fit for purpose tool;Good argument; Revolver, one-handed sword Strong \\(4e\\) Expert grade tool;Strong rationale;Autofire pistol, SMG, two-handed sword Extreme \\(5e\\) Tech augmented expert grade tool;Rifle, shotgun, large axe and bastard sword Challenge Effects (damage) applied to you reduces your Grit. Subtract the armour rating from the Effect, and then reduce the remainder from your Grit. Your Effects are subtracted directly from Challenges Disposition (i.e. Challenges do not have armour). Sometimes Challenge Effects fork into new Challenges or consequences. Extra Challenges might be an encounter, an unexpected detour, a hidden threat or some unlucky event. Consequences, on the other hand, pose some additional difficulty on the next Risky Action roll related to the Challenge. Effect Roll \\(\\mathbf{1:3}\\) \\(\\mathbf{4:5}\\) \\(\\mathbf{7:11}\\) \\(\\mathbf{13:17}\\) \\(\\mathbf{19+}\\) Extra Challenge Trivial Dangerous Serious Formidable Extreme Consequence \\(\\mathbf{-}\\) \\(1d\\) \\(2d\\) \\(3d\\) \\(4d+\\) 2.3 Challenges Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome Challenges. Examples of Challenges are fighting an enemy, dueling rhetorically, negotiating an environment, crawling a location, journeying. Challenges have disposition, which measures how much Effect they take to be overcame. Challenges also have Effect dice that are applied to you as consequences of your Risky Actions. Challenge Disposition Effect Examples Trivial \\(5\\) \\(d/2\\) Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey Dangerous \\(10\\) \\(1d\\) Skilled adversaries, small explosions, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey Serious \\(20\\) \\(2d\\) Expert adversaries, large predator, close contact with fire or acid Formidable \\(30\\) \\(3d\\) Human prime, apex predator, immersion in acid, large explosions Extreme \\(40+\\) \\(4d+\\) Transhuman, often fatal environments, most difficult journeys If multiple challenges gang up against you, increase the Challenge in one for each two additional challenges after the first. Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous Challenge to fight against, but a Trivial Challenge to be convinced to ignore you. 2.3.1 Montage You and the GM might prefer to resolve a Challenge in one single roll. That is possible by rolling the Challenge Effect prior to gathering your dice. Apply the consequence modifier to your dice and roll your Risky Action. You risk \\(2\\) Ego for each Dark Die you use. Your companions can also pool their Ego to help you. This single roll determine the outcome of the entire Challenge. It is not recommended to use Montages if the consequence of failure would be the death of someone. On those cases, playing the Challenge as a longer one gives more manoeuvre space. 2.4 Wounds When your Grit reaches \\(0\\) and you use all your Wound tracks you become mortally wounded, and will die if further harmed. While mortally wounded you cannot gather Light Die for your Risky Actions. You will die in minutes if not attended to. If you survive a mortal wound, you develop a permanent consequence. Roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below. With the GM, describe it narratively. Consequence \\(1\\) You take a Condition of your choice. \\(2\\) \\(-1\\) Prowess, you die if it goes below \\(0\\) \\(3\\) \\(-1\\) Sagacity, you die if it goes below \\(0\\) \\(4\\) \\(-1\\) Resolve, you die if it goes below \\(0\\) \\(5\\) When you re-roll your Ego, use \\(-1d\\) from now on. Its minimum is \\(1\\) \\(6\\) Re-roll your Grit with \\(-1d\\) from now on. Its minimum is \\(1\\). Each Wound track recovers through appropriate care and a week of rest. 2.5 Experience You get \\(2\\) Experience for each session you play. You gain \\(+1\\) Experience per Condition you develop. Each new Advancement costs the current number of Advancements times \\(2\\) in Experience. Decide with the GM how to carry this development out in the narrative. When you gain a new Advancement you also re-roll your Grit and keep the maximum between the current \\(+1\\) or the new value. 2.6 Fortune die When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll \\(1d\\). "],["making-a-game.html", "Section 3 Making a Game 3.1 Ego in Pulp Fantasy", " Section 3 Making a Game Terran Engine is focuses on the grimdark aesthetics, which might not be the thematic choice of every game. By adapting the Archetypes and Advancements, and reskinning Ego (and Conditions), other genres can easily be emulated. A few playtested examples are given. The Rules section can mostly be used as is. 3.1 Ego in Pulp Fantasy For the Pulp Fantasy genre, Ego can be used as a measure of how far the next climax is. Whenever relevant, the GM rolls one die. If the die is higher than the highest Ego of the Party, a climax event happens. After this climax, all Ego is restored to its original max.

"],["changelog.html", "B Changelog", " B Changelog v0.5.1 Suggested that a cohesive group shall be created, before individual character creation. Reduced number of Skills per Attribute to 2. Implemented system for gathering experience. Specialist and inept advancements are based on Cepheus skills. Changed: Changing code references to italic. Minor: Added link for new character sheet. Improved general texts Removed: Since attributes are already simplified, removed the further simpler 3 attribute version. v0.5.0 Major revisions on system: Attribute and Skills approach is now leveraging the Forged in The Dark SRD. Grit (and Wounds) have been revised, while reorganised text for Ego, maintained statistics for both. Re-wrote Advancements and Conditions to match changes of Attributes, Skills, Grit. Brought back the Precision and Effect trade-off in a single roll (from v0.3x), with an improved approach Reviewed Advancement statistics and approach New: Character Sheet for download Short Equipment section Expanded the section for Making a Game Wounds section Copyright for FitD Removed: Removed simulations from published book (for now) Copyright for Trophy Text and aesthetics improvements: Changed text font to match Character Sheet Changed game concepts aesthetics to code. Several text improvements due to changes required by system revision v0.4.5 Re-worked the HP/Wounds sub-system Made Skill list more specific Added Advancements and Conditions Simplified the level-up sub-system Text improvements v0.4.4 Added simulations to validate expected game mechanics statistics Aligned Challenges Disposition based on simulation Aligned HP and Ego based on simulation, and target compatibility with BLB Changed how HP and Attribute loss works Changed Attribute names Renamed Chance rolls to Risky Actions rolls New mechanic for gaining levels and improving skills New mechanic for Challenge Montages Added fortune die section Moved images to local references Text improvements: Character creation summary Attribute loss and skills Effects, including complications v0.4.3 Redefined Attributes and Skills values (kept statistics) Several table aesthetics improvements Expanded description of Challenges and Weapons Simplified Advancement Improved Chances text Created this Changelog v0.4.2 Finalised book aesthetics. Aligned with target statistics (BLB). Featured now generic content for Archetypes, Advancements and Conditions to replace their placeholders. Polished text and fixes. Added Make a Game section. v0.4.1 Started improving book aesthetics. Concept SRD might be complete. v0.4.0 Selection of Success, Effect and counter in one single roll proven to be complicated at the table. Chance roll is now separated from Effect, dark dice consume Ego. Changed Attribute names. Play tested with Trophy Dark’s Throne of Forest Queen scenario. v0.3x Rolls converted from 2d6 + mod to xd6 dice pools. Choose one die for success and one die for Effect. Dark dice determine counter effect from Challenges. Playtest with Kult’s Driver scenario, children and alone. Needs further simplification for fast playing. v0.2x Simplified the challenge die to a target number. Game runs on d6s only. Playtest with children and alone. Maths and selection at table are still convoluted (and might work bad for Discord games). v0.1x First version, where 3d6 + mod are rolled with a challenge die (d4 to d20). Player choose 2d6 + mod for success, 1d6 for effect. Playtest with children and alone and it felt convoluted.
