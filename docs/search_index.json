"],["characters.html", "Chapter 1 Characters 1.1 Archetypes 1.2 Attributes 1.3 HP and Ego 1.4 Advancements 1.5 Conditions", " Chapter 1 Characters Always start with a Name and an Archetype. Roll for Attributes. Calculate HP (hit points) and Ego. Choose one Advancement. 1.1 Archetypes You are defined by an Archetype, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative. Each Archetype should offer an immediate grasp your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial Archetypes towards unique narratives. The specific scenario you play might have a list of Archetypes. 1.2 Attributes You have four Attributes. Strength: physical power, endurance and might. Dexterity: agility, precision and physical sagacity. Insight: reasoning, understanding and empathy. Resolve: command, determination and personality heft. To determine Attribute values, roll 2d for each, take the highest, and consult the table below. After rolling, you may swap two values. Highest Die 1-3 4-5 6 Stat Value 0 1 2 Your Attributes determine the size of your Dice Pools when you are doing something that you are capable of, and have appropriate the equipment. In certain conditions, you might lose Attributes. Attribute loss is permanent and when any attribute goes below 0 you die. 1.2.1 Skills The specific scenario you play might have a list of Skills. These skills might be hierarchically related to Attributes. Skills are added to Attribute Dice Pools. Skill-based scenarios are generally more complex for the Players. 1.3 HP and Ego You have two measures of survival: HP (hit points) and Ego. HP (hit points) represent your health, physical disposition and endurance. You lose HP when you are physically harmed. To define your starting maximum HP, sum your Strength and Dexterity, and add 6. HP increase as you develop. The base rate of recovery is 1 HP per day. If you are being attended by someone, recover an addition HP. When your HP reaches 0 you lose one Attribute of your choice. You are unconscious and wake up with 1 HP after the scene ends. Attribute loss is permanent and when any attribute goes below 0 you die. Ego combines willpower, sanity and humanity. It might be spent when you push yourself in a risky situation or use some character Advancements. To determine your character’s starting maximum Ego, sum your Insight and Resolve, and add 3. Ego can never be higher than 6. Ego does not recover with rest or care, but by taking a Condition. When you take a Condition your Ego recovers to its maximum. When your Ego reaches 0 you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. 1.4 Advancements Every time PCs accumulate 8 XP, they gain an Advancement. Alongside an Advancement, a PC also gains +1 maximum HP and +1 maximum Ego. Extra Attribute: Gain +1 in one chosen Attribute. Attribute maximum is 2 in the first 10 advancements and 3 thereafter.

With the GM determine your appropriate Attribute. Then gather 6-sided dice. Dice Pool Take your appropriate Attribute (modified by Skills, if applicable) Dice Pool. If you don’t have any relevant Attribute Dice Pool, then you cannot take Light Dice. You can never take more than 4 Light Dice. Take as many Dark Dice as you wish to risk Ego for a desperate success. Roll the dice and look for the outcome of the highest value. Value Outcome 1-3 You fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe how it goes wrong. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. 4-5 You succeed, but there’s some kind of complication. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed. 6 You succeed. With the GM describe what happens. For each Dark Dice that is equal or higher than your current Ego, decrease your Ego in one. If the Risky Action is part of a longer Challenge, roll Effects as appropriate. 2.2 Challenges Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome Challenges. Examples of Challenges are a fighting enemy, a rhetoric duel, an environment to be negotiated with, a location crawl, a journey. Challenges have Disposition, which measures how much Effect they takes to be overcame. Armours do not modify Effects applied to a Challenge’s Disposition, like they do for your HP. Challenges may also have their own Effect Dice, that are applied to you as consequences of your Risky Actions. Challenge Level Disposition Effect Dice Examples Trivial 1 d3 Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey Dangerous 5 1d Skilled adversaries, small explosions, troublesome journey Serious 10 2d Expert adversareis, predator, close contact with fire or acid Formidable 15 3d Human prime, apex predator, immersion in acid, large explosions Extreme 20 4d Transhuman, often fatal environments, most difficult journey possible If multiple challenges gang up against you, increase the Challenge Level in one for each two additional challenges after the first. Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous Challenge to fight against, but a Trivial Challenge to be convinced to ignore you. Note that Trivial Challenges are nothing more than a single Risky Action. 2.3 Effects Effects determines the quantitative result of your Risky Actions towards overcoming a longer Challenge. Examples of Effects are Damage given, Convincing done, Distance covered. When you roll Effect Dice, only the highest result is relevant. This highest die is exploding (every time the result is a natural 6, re-roll and accumulate the result). Different tools may modify the Effect Dice rolled. Examples for weapons are Weapon type Effect Die Details Light melee 1d3 Apply Effect before your rival Medium melee 1d6 Effect Die is read as 1d6+1 when held with both hands Heavy melee 2d6 Apply Effect after your rivalTwo handed Light ranged 1d6 Medium ranged 1d6+2 Effect Die is 2d6 when expend all ammo (needs reloading).Two handed Heavy ranged 2d One action to ready before every shot gives Light Dice Pool +1dTwo handed Improvised 1d3 Light Dice Pool -1d (not appropriate tool) Physical harm Effects applied to you impacts your HP. The armour you wear modifies the Effect. Subtract the modified Effect from your HP. Armour type Retribution modifier Details Light -1 Heavy -2 Disadvantageous (-1d) to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. Shield -1 Can be sacrificed to completely avoid the Effect. Sometimes Challenge Effects forks into new Challenges. These might be an encounter, an unexpected detour or some unlucky event. Consult the Challenge fork table.
