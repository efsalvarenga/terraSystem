[["index.html", "Terran Engine Terran Engine SRD v0.4.4 Taxonomy", " Terran Engine Terran Engine SRD v0.4.4 Terran Engine is a rules light tabletop roleplaying system focused on narrative, player agency and consequences. Only 6-sided dice are used, in two tones: Light Dice and Dark Dice. Taxonomy “You” and “Your” are used interchangeably to refer to players and their characters. For disambiguation “Player(s)” is used when referring to the player outside the context of their character. “Challenge” is used to represent anything that is antagonistic to you, be that an NPC, the environment, etc. Meta game names, stats and currencies are marked in bold. Book references are marked in italic, they might be accompanied by page ranges. "],["characters.html", "Section 1 Characters 1.1 Archetypes 1.2 Attributes 1.3 HP and Ego 1.4 Advancements 1.5 Conditions", " Section 1 Characters Always start with a Name and an Archetype. Roll for Attributes and choose Skills. Calculate HP (hit points) and Ego. Optional Choose one Advancement and increase your \\(\\textbf{HP}_{max}\\) in \\(\\mathbf{1}\\). 1.1 Archetypes You are defined by an Archetype, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative. Each Archetype should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial Archetypes towards unique narratives. Hero: Embodies courage and strength, often the protagonist fighting against the odds. Mentor: Provides guidance and wisdom, helping the hero on their journey. Everyman: Represents the common man, relatability and realism. Innocent: Embodies purity, optimism, and faith. Ruler: Exudes control, responsibility, and sovereignty. Sage: Seeks truth, knowledge, and wisdom. Explorer: Loves discovering new worlds, autonomy, and the freedom to find out who they are through exploration. Outlaw: Represents rebellion, breaking the rules, and fighting against the status quo. Magician: Transforms reality, embodies vision and imagination. Lover: Pursues connection, romance, and passion. Jester: Values joy, humor, and light-heartedness. Caregiver: Provides nurture, generosity, and compassion. 1.2 Attributes You have four Attributes. Strength: physical power, endurance and might. Agility: dexterity, precision and physical sagacity. Insight: perception, understanding and reasoning. Charisma: empathy, command and personality heft. To determine Attribute values, roll \\(\\mathbf{2d}\\) for each, take the highest, and consult the table below. \\(\\mathbf{1:3}\\) \\(\\mathbf{4:5}\\) \\(\\mathbf{6}\\) Attribute \\(\\circ\\circ\\circ\\) \\(\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\) \\(\\bullet\\bullet\\circ\\) In certain conditions, you might lose Attributes. Lost Attributes are recovered at the rate of \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) per week, if you receive appropriate care. Permanent Attribute loss is never recovered. 1.2.1 Skills Everyone is better at some things. You have \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) points to assign to Skills you are good at. These may be based on your Archetype. With the GM you can adapt or expand the generic list of Skills provided. Violence: brawl, shoot, melee, exert; Exploration: notice, sneak, pilot, navigate; Social: connect, lead, perform, talk; Survival: forage, craft, heal, tame; Vocational: admin, program, know, trade Optional The game might ignore Skills and focus on Attributes only. If that is the case, choose one Attribute and increase it in \\(\\mathbf{1}\\). 1.3 HP and Ego You have two measures of survival: HP (hit points) and Ego. 1.3.1 HP (hit points) HP represents your health, physical disposition and endurance. You lose HP when you are physically harmed. \\(\\mathbf{\\textbf{HP}_{max}}\\) is calculated by adding your physical Attributes (Strength and Agility) with \\(\\mathbf{2}\\). You gain \\(\\mathbf{+1}\\textbf{ HP}_{max}\\) for each Advancement you have. The base rate of recovery is 1 HP per day. If you are being attended by someone, recover an additional HP. When your HP reaches 0 you start loosing Attributes (you choose which). If any Attribute becomes negative you are unconscious and lose \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) in that Attribute permanently. You wake up with \\(\\mathbf{1}\\textbf{ HP}\\) after the scene ends. If any Attribute becomes permanently negative, you die. 1.3.2 Ego Ego represents your resolve, sanity and humanity. You spend it when you push yourself in a risky situation or use some character Advancements. \\(\\mathbf{\\textbf{Ego}_{max}}\\) is calculated by adding your mental Attributes (Insight and Empathy) with \\(\\mathbf{2}\\). Ego does not recover with rest or care, but by taking a permanent Condition. When you take a Condition your Ego recovers to its maximum. When your Ego reaches 0 you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. 1.4 Advancements At the end of each session take one die for each Ego you have lost. Distribute this dice pool in any way you see fit for progressing your capabilities. Roll Advancement If the sum of your dice is higher than the sum of your \\(\\textbf{Ego}_{max}\\) and \\(\\textbf{HP}_{max}\\) you gain an Advancement and \\(\\mathbf{+1} \\textbf{ HP}_{max}\\) Skill Development If the sum of your dice is higher than the sum of the Attribute and Skill you chose, the Skill increases in \\(\\textbf{+1}\\). You can only try to increase Skills you have used during the session. The list of Advancements below may be adapted or expanded, if necessary. Extra Attribute: Increase a chosen Attribute in \\(\\mathbf{1}\\). Protected: Roll Dark Dice. Their sum can be reduced from damage you received. Lose one Ego for each of them that is lower than your current Ego. Sensory acuity: You have \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) on actions related to a chosen sense. Sneak attack: You have \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) to attack and damage to unaware rivals. Sniper: When you spend a turn aiming you have \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) to attack and damage to a rival. Rally: When you rally your allies, a number equal to the number of Dark Dice rolled get \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) until the end of the scene. Multi-attack: In melee, you deal one additional instance of Damage for each Dark Dice that shows a \\(\\mathbf{6}\\). Tough: Gain one additional HP per Advancement. Curse: You bring a curse to your rivals. A number equal to the number of Dark Dice rolled get \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\) until the end of the scene. 1.5 Conditions At any moment in the game you can recover your Ego back to its maximum by taking a Condition. The recovery of your inner strength often comes through confronting, enduring, and adapting to hardship. These trials teach you to integrate the traumas that permanently transform your self, strengthening your resilience. With the GM, determine the new Condition you have, and how to introduce it into the narrative. Conditions are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative. The list below can be used as a starting point. With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones. Fear-Driven Vigilance: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you have \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\). Obsessive Focus: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Gain \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) in one skill and \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\) in three other skills. Moral Reservations: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Actions that go against your moral code have \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\). Compulsive Honesty: You vow to always speak the truth. Kleptomaniac: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don’t really need. Battle-Scarred: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically. Protective Instinct: You are genuinely concerned with your team’s welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you have \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\). Estranged: You lose the bond with someone you love or cherish, \\(\\textbf{Ego}_{max} - 1\\). "],["rules.html", "Section 2 Rules 2.1 Risky Actions 2.2 Challenges 2.3 Fortune die", " Section 2 Rules 2.1 Risky Actions When you are trying your chances at a Risky Action, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate Attribute (and Skill, if applicable). Then gather 6-sided dice. Dice Pool Take a number of Light Dice equal to your Attribute (and Skill, if applicable). If you are in an advantageous or precarious position, the GM may give you \\(\\mathbf{\\pm 1d}\\). You must always have between \\(\\mathbf{0}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) Light Dice. Take as many Dark Dice as you wish to risk Ego for pushing yourself for a success. For each Dark Dice that rolls equal or lower than your current Ego, decrease your Ego in one. Roll the dice and look for the outcome of the highest value. Outcome \\(\\mathbf{1:3}\\) You fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe how it goes wrong. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. \\(\\mathbf{4:5}\\) You succeed, but there’s some kind of complication. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed. \\(\\mathbf{6}\\) You succeed. With the GM describe what happens. If the Risky Action is part of a longer Challenge, roll Effects as appropriate. 2.2 Challenges Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome Challenges. Examples of Challenges are fighting an enemy, dueling rhetorically, negotiating an environment, crawling a location, journeying. Challenges have Disposition, which measures how much Effect they take to be overcame. Challenges also have Effect Dice that are applied to you as consequences of your Risky Actions. Challenge Level Disposition Effect Examples Trivial \\(\\mathbf{5}\\) \\(\\mathbf{d/2}\\) Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey Dangerous \\(\\mathbf{10}\\) \\(\\mathbf{1d}\\) Skilled adversaries, small explosions, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey Serious \\(\\mathbf{20}\\) \\(\\mathbf{2d}\\) Expert adversaries, large predator, close contact with fire or acid Formidable \\(\\mathbf{30}\\) \\(\\mathbf{3d}\\) Human prime, apex predator, immersion in acid, large explosions Extreme \\(\\mathbf{40}\\) \\(\\mathbf{4d}\\) Transhuman, often fatal environments, most difficult journeys Fantastical \\(\\mathbf{10n}\\) \\(\\mathbf{nd}\\) Anything… If multiple challenges gang up against you, increase the Challenge Level in one for each two additional challenges after the first. Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous Challenge to fight against, but a Trivial Challenge to be convinced to ignore you. 2.2.1 Effects Effects determines the quantitative result of your Risky Actions towards overcoming a longer Challenge. Examples of Effects are Damage given, Convincing done, Distance covered. When you roll Effect Dice, only the highest result is relevant. This highest die is exploding (every time the result is a natural 6, re-roll and accumulate the result). Different tools may modify the Effect Dice rolled. Equipment Effect Examples Details Lesser tool;Small weapon \\(\\mathbf{d / 2}\\) Primitive tool;Knife, staff, small revolver Improvised tools: Risky Action \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\) Normal tool;Medium weapon \\(\\mathbf{1d}\\) Fit for purpose tool;Sword, large pistol, SMG Effect \\(\\mathbf{1d+1}\\) if held two handed. Greater tool;Large weapon \\(\\mathbf{2d}\\) Expert grade tool;Large axe, bastard sword, shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun; Requires two hands. Physical harm Effects applied to you impacts your HP, and Attributes when you reach \\(\\mathbf{0}\\) HP. The armour you wear modifies the Effect. Subtract the modified Effect from your HP or Attributes. Armours do not modify Effects applied to a Challenge’s Disposition, like they do for you. Armour Modifier Details Light \\(\\mathbf{-1}\\) Heavy \\(\\mathbf{-2}\\) Chances \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\) to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. Shield \\(\\mathbf{-1}\\) Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an Effect. Sometimes Challenge Effects forks into new Challenges or complications on the current Challenge. Extra Challenges might be an encounter, an unexpected detour, a hidden threat or some unlucky event. Complications, on the other hand, pose some additional difficulty on the next Risky Action roll related to the Challenge. Effect Roll 1-3 4-5 7-11 13+ Challenge Trivial Dangerous Serious Formidable Complication \\(\\mathbf{-}\\) \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\) \\(\\mathbf{-2d}\\) \\(\\mathbf{-3d}\\) 2.2.2 Montage You and the GM might prefer to resolve a Challenge in one single roll. That is possible by rolling the Challenge Effect prior to gathering your Dice Pool. Apply the Complication modifier to your Dice Pool and roll your Risky Action. You risk \\(\\mathbf{2}\\) Ego for each Dark Die you use. Your companions can also pool their Ego to help you. This single roll determine the outcome of the entire Challenge. It is not recommended to use Montages if the consequence of failure would be the death of someone. On those cases, playing the Challenge as a longer one gives more manoeuvre space. 2.3 Fortune die When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, define the chances and roll \\(\\mathbf{1d}\\).

Aligned with target statistics (BLB). Featured now generic content for Archetypes, Advancements and Conditions to replace their placeholders. Polished text and fixes. Added Make a Game section. v0.4.1 Started improving book aesthetics. Concept SRD might be complete. v0.4.0 Selection of Success, Effect and counter in one single roll proven to be complicated at the table. Chance roll is now separated from Effect, dark dice consume Ego. Changed Attribute names. Play tested with Trophy Dark’s Throne of Forest Queen scenario. v0.3x Rolls converted from 2d6 + mod to xd6 dice pools. Choose one die for success and one die for Effect. Dark dice determine counter effect from Challenges. Playtest with Kult’s Driver scenario, children and alone. Needs further simplification for fast playing. v0.2x Simplified the challenge die to a target number. Game runs on d6s only. Playtest with children and alone. Maths and selection at table are still convoluted (and might work bad for Discord games). v0.1x First version, where 3d6 + mod are rolled with a challenge die (d4 to d20). Player choose 2d6 + mod for success, 1d6 for effect. Playtest with children and alone and it felt convoluted.
