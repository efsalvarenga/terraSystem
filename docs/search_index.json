[["index.html", "Terran Engine Terran Engine SRD v0.5.3a Taxonomy", " Terran Engine Terran Engine SRD v0.5.3a Terran Engine is a rules light tabletop roleplaying system focused on narrative, player agency and consequences. Only 6-sided dice are used, in two tones: Light Dice and Dark Dice. A character sheet is available for download, but any piece of paper is enough to play. You will also need some pencils and friends. Taxonomy “You” and “Your” are used interchangeably to refer to players and their characters. For disambiguation “Player(s)” is used when referring to the player outside the context of their character. “Challenge” is used to represent anything that is antagonistic to you, be that an NPC, the environment, etc. Meta game concepts, stats and currencies are marked as italic. Book references are marked in code, they might be accompanied by page ranges. "],["characters.html", "Section 1 Characters 1.1 Archetypes 1.2 Skills &amp; Attributes 1.3 Grit &amp; Ego 1.4 Advancements 1.5 Conditions 1.6 Equipment", " Section 1 Characters With the other players, define a cohesive group concept. Always start with a Name and an Archetype. Roll for Attributes and assign Skills Roll for Grit and Ego. Optional: Choose one Advancement. A character sheet is available here. 1.1 Archetypes You are defined by an Archetype, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative. Each Archetype should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial Archetypes towards unique narratives. Hero: Embodies courage and strength, often the protagonist fighting against the odds. Mentor: Provides guidance and wisdom, helping the hero on their journey. Everyman: Represents the common man, relatability and realism. Innocent: Embodies purity, optimism, and faith. Ruler: Exudes control, responsibility, and sovereignty. Sage: Seeks truth, knowledge, and wisdom. Explorer: Loves discovering new worlds, autonomy, and the freedom to find out who they are through exploration. Outlaw: Represents rebellion, breaking the rules, and fighting against the status quo. Magician: Transforms reality, embodies vision and imagination. Lover: Pursues connection, romance, and passion. Jester: Values joy, humor, and light-heartedness. Caregiver: Provides nurture, generosity, and compassion. 1.2 Skills &amp; Attributes There are \\(6\\) Skills that you can use to overcome obstacles. Intuition: track targets, understand creatures, care, survive. Reason: concentrate, think abstractly, build knowledge. Finesse: dextrous manipulation, precision, subtle misdirection. Exertion: apply physical force and power, melee. Attunement: get in the flow and tune the arcane or technology. Influence: compel obedience, socialise, influence. Each Skill has a rating (from \\(0d\\) to \\(4d\\)) that determine how many dice to roll when performing Risky Actions. Attributes are groupings of two Skills each. Attributes also have ratings (from \\(0d\\) to \\(2d\\)) that determine how many dice to roll when facing a Risky Action passively (Saves). Insight Skills: Intuition, Reason; Save: Reflexes Prowess Skills: Finesse, Exertion; Save: Fortitude Resolve Skills: Attunement, Influence; Save: Willpower For each Attribute (Insight, Prowess, and Resolve) roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below to determine how many Attribute dice you have to distribute to their Skills. \\(1:3\\) \\(4:5\\) \\(6\\) Attribute Dice \\(1d\\) \\(2d\\) \\(3d\\) In certain conditions, you might permanently lose Attribute dice. 1.3 Grit &amp; Ego “It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward” (Rocky Balboa) While Grit represents your physical disposition, Ego represents your resilience. Roll \\(1d\\) to determine your initial Grit maximum and initial Ego. Advancements and conditions may change these numbers. After a well fed and rested night, you recover \\(1d\\) of Grit lost. At any moment, you may choose to take a Condition and roll \\(1d\\) to reset your Ego. 1.3.1 Wounds You lose Grit when you are physically harmed. When your Grit reaches \\(0\\) you become Mortally Wounded and will die if harmed. Anytime you are hurt, you can choose to gain a Wound instead of losing Grit. You have \\(3\\) Wound tracks: Stressed (\\(-1d\\) Insight), Broken (\\(-1d\\) Prowess) and Weary (\\(-1d\\) Resolve). While Mortally Wounded you cannot gather Light Die for your Risky Actions. You will die in minutes if not attended to. If you survive a Mortal Wound, you develop a Malaise. Roll \\(1d\\) and consult the table below. With the GM, describe it narratively. Malaises \\(1\\) No Malaise. \\(2\\) \\(-1d\\) Prowess, you die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(3\\) \\(-1d\\) Insight, you die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(4\\) \\(-1d\\) Resolve, you die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(5\\) When you re-roll your Ego, use \\(-1d\\) from now on. You die if it goes below \\(0d\\). \\(6\\) Re-roll your Grit with \\(-1d\\) from now on. You die if it goes below \\(0d\\). Each Wound track recovers through appropriate care and a week of rest. A Malaise never recovers. 1.3.2 Pushing yourself You spend Ego when you push beyond yourself in Risky Actions or use some character Advancements. When your Ego reaches \\(0\\) you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. 1.4 Advancements Advancements can have any narrative reasoning you want. The list below are examples of a simple framework for their in-game mechanics: Eager: When you reset your Ego, roll \\(+1d\\) and keep the highest. Die Hard: When you reset your Grit maximum, roll \\(+1d\\) and sum all the dice you rolled. Skill: Gain \\(1d\\) in a Skill. The maximum you can have in all Skills together is \\(10d\\). Specialist: Choose a specific type of action. When you Fail it in a Risky Actions you still succeed, with Reduced Effect. For a list of specialisations, check Cepheus SRD’s skill list. Adept: You have knowledge in one school of magic. Spellcasting rules tbd Tough: When unarmored your Armour is \\(1\\). Bodyguard: You can choose to take damage instead of one of your allies. Sensory acuity: You have \\(+1d\\) on noticing things through a chosen sense. Whirlwind: In combat, roll a Prowess Skill and Dark Dice. If you are successful, deal one additional instance of Effect to a Challenge at range. Fast: When you roll, your Effect is always applied first. 1.5 Conditions At any moment in the game you can re-roll your Ego by taking a Condition. The recovery of your inner strength often comes through confronting, enduring, and adapting to hardship. These trials teach you to integrate the traumas that permanently transform your self, strengthening your resilience. With the GM, determine the new Condition you have, and how to introduce it into the narrative. Conditions are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative. The list below can be used as a starting point. With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones. Fear-Driven Vigilance: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you have \\(-1d\\) Obsessive Focus: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Gain \\(+1\\) Point in one Skill and \\(-1\\) Point in two other Skills. Inept: For some reason you become inept in a specific type of action. Every time you Succeed it in a Risky Actions you accomplish with Reduced Effect. For a list of specialisations, check Cepheus SRD’s skill list. Moral Reservations: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Actions that go against your moral code have \\(-1d\\). Compulsive Honesty: You vow to always speak the truth. Kleptomaniac: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don’t really need. Battle-Scarred: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically, intellectually or socially. Protective Instinct: You are genuinely concerned with your team’s welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you have \\(-1d\\). Estranged: You lose the bond with someone you love or cherish. With the GM, agree the mechanical impact. Slow: When you roll, your Effect is always applied last. 1.6 Equipment With the GM define which tags, ranges and Effect are appropriate for your weapons. Weapons used outside their expected ranges roll with \\(-1d\\). The following short list of tags may be expanded with the GM. Versatile: \\(+1e\\) when held two-handed. Nimble: Effect is applied first Slaughter: Effect die explode on \\(5+\\) Armours act as buffers when you take damage from Challenges. Subtract the armour modifier from the Effect before reducing your Grit Armour Modifier Details Light \\(-1\\) Heavy \\(-2\\) \\(-1d\\) to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. Shield \\(-1\\) Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an Effect. "],["rules.html", "Section 2 Rules 2.1 Risky Actions 2.2 Experience 2.3 Fortune die 2.4 Sayonara", " Section 2 Rules 2.1 Risky Actions When you are trying your chances at a Risky Action, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate Attribute or Skill. Then gather 6-sided dice. Dice Pool Take a number of Light Dice equal to your applicable Attribute or Skill. If you are in an advantageous or precarious position, the GM may give you \\(\\pm 1d\\). You must always roll between \\(0d\\) and \\(4d\\) Light Dice. Take as many Dark Dice as you wish to risk Ego for pushing yourself for a success. For each Dark Die that rolls equal or lower than your current Ego, decrease your Ego in one. Roll the dice and choose one die to be your Precision (generally the highest, but you might choose differently if you wish) and consult the table. Outcome \\(1:3\\) You Fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe the consequences. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. \\(4:5\\) You Succeed, but there’s some consequences. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed. \\(6\\) You Succeed. With the GM describe what happens. Evaluate Effects as appropriate, if the Risky Action is part of a Challenge, 2.1.1 Effects Effects determines the quantitative result of your Risky Actions towards overcoming Challenges. Examples of Effects are: Damage given, Convincing done, Distance covered, Weakness learned. When you roll your Risky Actions, choose one die to be your Effect (generally the second highest, if the highest was used as Precision). The Effect die is an exploding die (i.e. if the result is a \\(6\\), keep rolling and accumulating the result). The Effect you apply is never lower than the Effect Tier of your approach, regardless of the die outcome. Your Effect is subtracted from the Challenge Disposition. Tier Minimum Effect for \\(1e\\)Improvised Makeshift tool;Rock, pipe, punch. \\(2e\\)Reduced Primitive tool;Weak argumentKnife, staff \\(3e\\)Standard Fit for purpose tool;Good argument; Revolver, one-handed sword \\(4e\\)Increased Expert grade tool;Strong rationale;Autofire pistol, SMG, two-handed sword \\(5e\\)Extreme Tech augmented expert grade tool;Rifle, shotgun, large axe and bastard sword 2.1.2 Challenges Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome Challenges. Examples of Challenges are fighting an enemy, dueling rhetorically, negotiating an environment, crawling a location, journeying. Challenges have disposition, which measures how much Effect they take to be overcame. Challenges also have Effect dice that are applied to you as consequences of your Risky Actions. Tier Disposition Effect Examples \\(0\\)Trivial \\(5\\) \\(d/2\\) Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey \\(1\\)Dangerous \\(10\\) \\(1d\\) Skilled adversaries, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey \\(2\\)Serious \\(20\\) \\(2d\\) Expert adversaries, large predator, traverse fire or acid \\(3\\)Formidable \\(30\\) \\(3d\\) Human prime, apex predator, climbing the Everest \\(4\\)Exceptional \\(40+\\) \\(4d+\\) Transhuman, often fatal environments, heroic journeys Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous Challenge to fight against, but a Trivial Challenge to be convinced to ignore you. When Challenge Effects are applied to you narratively, use the table. Consequence \\(1:3\\) Something annoying happens. \\(4:5\\) Something frustrating happens. \\(6\\) Something devastating happens. When Challenge Effects are applied to you as damage your Grit might be reduced. Subtract the armour rating from the Effect, and then reduce the remainder from your Grit. You may choose to mark a Wound track instead of receiving damage. 2.1.3 Magnitude Sometimes you and the GM might need to compare different dimensions of Magnitudes. Tier Area Party Duration Range Harm Severity \\(0\\)Poor Closet \\(1\\) person Moment Contact \\(d/2\\) Minor injury. Sprains and bruising. \\(1\\)Good Corner \\(3\\) people Scene Reach \\(1d\\) Bleeding cuts and broken bones. Small explosions. \\(2\\)Excellent Room \\(10\\) people Hour Nearby \\(2d\\) Close contact with bodily destructive phenomena (such as fire, explosions, or acid). \\(3\\)Impecable Wing \\(30\\) people Day Far away \\(3d\\) Large explosions. Immersive contact with fi re and acid. \\(4\\)Legendary Building \\(100\\) people Week Remote \\(4d\\) Usually fatal harm, often immediately. 2.2 Experience You get \\(2\\) Experience for each session you play. You gain \\(+1\\) Experience per Condition you develop. Each new Advancement costs the current number of Advancements times \\(3\\) in Experience. Decide with the GM how to carry this development out in the narrative. When you gain a new Advancement you reset your Grit maximum. Roll your dice and keep the maximum between the current and the new value. 2.3 Fortune die When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll \\(1d\\). 2.4 Sayonara At any moment you can decide it is your last scene. When you do that, re-roll your Ego and Grit. For this scene, you only expend Ego if you roll a \\(1\\). By the end of the scene, you have to figure out how you depart (death, madness, mission, etc.). You can create a new character with half (rounded up) the number of Advances the previous character had. "],["making-a-game.html", "Section 3 Making a Game 3.1 Ego in Pulp Fantasy", " Section 3 Making a Game Terran Engine is focuses on the grimdark aesthetics, which might not be the thematic choice of every game. By adapting the Archetypes and Advancements, and reskinning Ego (and Conditions), other genres can easily be emulated. A few playtested examples are given. The Rules section can mostly be used as is. 3.1 Ego in Pulp Fantasy For the Pulp Fantasy genre, Ego can be used as a measure of how far the next climax is. Whenever relevant, the GM rolls one die. If the die is higher than the highest Ego of the Party, a climax event happens. After this climax, all Ego is restored to its original max. Test with imgur image, and auto publish.
