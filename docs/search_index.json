"],["characters.html", "Section 1 Characters 1.1 Archetypes 1.2 Attributes 1.3 HP and Ego 1.4 Advancements 1.5 Conditions", " Section 1 Characters Always start with a Name and an Archetype. Roll for Attributes. Calculate HP (hit points) and Ego. Choose one Advancement. 1.1 Archetypes You are defined by an Archetype, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative. Each Archetype should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial Archetypes towards unique narratives. Hero: Embodies courage and strength, often the protagonist fighting against the odds. Mentor: Provides guidance and wisdom, helping the hero on their journey. Everyman: Represents the common man, relatability and realism. Innocent: Embodies purity, optimism, and faith. Ruler: Exudes control, responsibility, and sovereignty. Sage: Seeks truth, knowledge, and wisdom. Explorer: Loves discovering new worlds, autonomy, and the freedom to find out who they are through exploration. Outlaw: Represents rebellion, breaking the rules, and fighting against the status quo. Magician: Transforms reality, embodies vision and imagination. Lover: Pursues connection, romance, and passion. Jester: Values joy, humor, and light-heartedness. Caregiver: Provides nurture, generosity, and compassion. 1.2 Attributes You have four Attributes. Strength: physical power, endurance and might. Dexterity: agility, precision and physical sagacity. Insight: reasoning, understanding and empathy. Resolve: command, determination and personality heft. To determine Attribute values, roll \\(\\mathbf{2d}\\) for each, take the highest, and consult the table below. \\(\\mathbf{1:3}\\) \\(\\mathbf{4:5}\\) \\(\\mathbf{6}\\) Attribute \\(\\circ\\circ\\circ\\) \\(\\bullet\\circ\\circ\\) \\(\\bullet\\bullet\\circ\\) In certain conditions, you might lose Attributes. Attribute loss is permanent and when any attribute goes below 0 you die. 1.2.1 Skills Everyone is better at some things. Choose four specific Skills you are good at. These may be based on your Archetype. With the GM you can adapt or expand the generic list of Skills provided. Violence: brawl, shoot, melee, exert; Exploration: notice, sneak, pilot, navigate; Social: connect, lead, perform, talk; Survival: forage, craft, heal, tame; Vocational: admin, program, know, trade Alternatively, the game might ignore Skills and focus on Attributes only. If that is the case, choose one Attribute and increase it in \\(\\mathbf{1}\\). 1.3 HP and Ego You have two measures of survival: HP (hit points) and Ego. These measures increase as you become more seasoned. HP (hit points) HP represent your health, physical disposition and endurance. You lose HP when you are physically harmed. \\(\\mathbf{\\textbf{HP}_{max}=\\textbf{Strength}+ \\textbf{Dexterity}+5}\\) The base rate of recovery is 1 HP per day. If you are being attended by someone, recover an addition HP. When your HP reaches 0 you permanently lose one Attribute of your choice. You are unconscious and wake up with 1 HP after the scene ends. Ego Ego combines willpower, sanity and humanity. You spend it when you push yourself in a risky situation or use some character Advancements. \\(\\mathbf{\\textbf{Ego}_{max}=\\textbf{Insight}+\\textbf{Resolve}+3}\\) Ego does not recover with rest or care, but by taking a permanent Condition. When you take a Condition your Ego recovers to its maximum. When your Ego reaches 0 you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. Ego does not recover with rest or care, but by taking a permanent Condition. When you take a Condition your Ego recovers to its maximum. When your Ego reaches 0 you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. 1.4 Advancements Once every \\(\\mathbf{2}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{5}\\) sessions, when the GM deems appropriate, you gain an Advancement, \\(\\mathbf{+1} \\textbf{ HP}_{max}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{+1} \\textbf{ Ego}_{max}\\). The list of Advancements below may be adapted or expanded, if necessary. Extra Attribute: Increase a chosen Attribute in \\(\\mathbf{1}\\). Protected: Roll Dark Dice. Their sum can be reduced from damage you received. Lose one Ego for each of them that is lower than your current Ego. Sensory acuity: You have \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) on actions related to a chosen sense. Sneak attack: You have \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) to attack and damage to unaware rivals. Sniper: When you spend a turn aiming you have \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) to attack and damage to a rival. Rally: When you rally your allies, a number equal to the number of Dark Dice rolled get \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) until the end of the scene. Multi-attack: In melee, you deal one additional instance of Damage for each Dark Dice that shows a \\(\\mathbf{6}\\). Tough: Gain one additional HP per Advancement. Curse: You bring a curse to your rivals. A number equal to the number of Dark Dice rolled get \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\) until the end of the scene. 1.5 Conditions At any moment in the game you can recover your Ego back to its maximum by taking a Condition. The recovery of your inner strength often comes through confronting, enduring, and adapting to hardship. These trials teach you to integrate the traumas that permanently transform your self, strengthening your resilience. With the GM, determine the new Condition you have, and how to introduce it into the narrative. Conditions are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative. The list below can be used as a starting point. With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones. Fear-Driven Vigilance: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you have \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\). Obsessive Focus: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Gain \\(\\mathbf{+1d}\\) in one skill and \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\) in three other skills. Moral Reservations: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Actions that go against your moral code have \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\). Compulsive Honesty: You vow to always speak the truth. Kleptomaniac: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don’t really need. Battle-Scarred: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically. Protective Instinct: You are genuinely concerned with your team’s welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you have \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\). "],["rules.html", "Section 2 Rules 2.1 Chances 2.2 Challenges 2.3 Effects", " Section 2 Rules 2.1 Chances When you are trying your chances at a risky action, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate Attribute and Skill, if applicable. Then gather 6-sided dice. Everytime your action leverages one of the things you are good at, you get …. Dice Pool Take a number of Light Dice equal to your Attribute and Skill, if applicable. You can have \\(\\mathbf{0:4}\\) Light Dice. Take as many Dark Dice as you wish to risk Ego for pushing yourself for a success. Roll the dice and look for the outcome of the highest value. Outcome \\(\\mathbf{1:3}\\) You fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe how it goes wrong. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. \\(\\mathbf{4:5}\\) You succeed, but there’s some kind of complication. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed. \\(\\mathbf{6}\\) You succeed. With the GM describe what happens. For each Dark Dice that is equal or lower than your current Ego, decrease your Ego in one. If the Risky Action is part of a longer Challenge, roll Effects as appropriate. 2.2 Challenges Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome Challenges. Examples of Challenges are fighting an enemy, dueling rhetorically, negotiating an environment, crawling a location, journeying. Challenges have Disposition, which measures how much Effect they take to be overcame. Challenges may also have their own Effect Dice, that are applied to you as consequences of your Risky Actions. Challenge Level Disposition Effect Examples Trivial \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) \\(\\mathbf{1d / 2}\\) Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey Dangerous \\(\\mathbf{5}\\) \\(\\mathbf{1d}\\) Skilled adversaries, small explosions, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey Serious \\(\\mathbf{10}\\) \\(\\mathbf{2d}\\) Expert adversaries, large predator, close contact with fire or acid Formidable \\(\\mathbf{15}\\) \\(\\mathbf{3d}\\) Human prime, apex predator, immersion in acid, large explosions Extreme \\(\\mathbf{20}\\) \\(\\mathbf{4d}\\) Transhuman, often fatal environments, most difficult journeys If multiple challenges gang up against you, increase the Challenge Level in one for each two additional challenges after the first. Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous Challenge to fight against, but a Trivial Challenge to be convinced to ignore you. Note that Trivial Challenges are nothing more than a single Risky Action. 2.3 Effects Effects determines the quantitative result of your Risky Actions towards overcoming a longer Challenge. Examples of Effects are Damage given, Convincing done, Distance covered. When you roll Effect Dice, only the highest result is relevant. This highest die is exploding (every time the result is a natural 6, re-roll and accumulate the result). Different tools may modify the Effect Dice rolled. Examples for weapons are Weapon Effect Examples Details Small \\(\\mathbf{1d / 2}\\) Knife, staff, small revolver Improvised weapons: Chances \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\) Medium \\(\\mathbf{1d}\\) Sword, large pistol, SMG Effect \\(\\mathbf{1d+1}\\) if held two handed. Heavy \\(\\mathbf{2d}\\) Large axe, bastard sword, shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun Requires two hands. Physical harm Effects applied to you impacts your HP. The armour you wear modifies the Effect. Subtract the modified Effect from your HP. Armours do not modify Effects applied to a Challenge’s Disposition, like they do for your HP. Armour Modifier Details Light \\(\\mathbf{-1}\\) Heavy \\(\\mathbf{-2}\\) Chances \\(\\mathbf{-1d}\\) to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. Shield \\(\\mathbf{-1}\\) Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an Effect. Sometimes Challenge Effects forks into new Challenges. These might be an encounter, an unexpected detour or some unlucky event. Consult the Challenge fork table.

Aligned with target statistics (BLB). Featured now generic content for Archetypes, Advancements and Conditions to replace their placeholders. Polished text and fixes. Added Make a Game section. v0.4.1 Started improving book aesthetics. Concept SRD might be complete. v0.4.0 Selection of Success, Effect and counter in one single roll proven to be complicated at the table. Chance roll is now separated from Effect, dark dice consume Ego. Changed Attribute names. Play tested with Trophy Dark’s Throne of Forest Queen scenario. v0.3x Rolls converted from 2d6 + mod to xd6 dice pools. Choose one die for success and one die for Effect. Dark dice determine counter effect from Challenges. Playtest with Kult’s Driver scenario, children and alone. Needs further simplification for fast playing. v0.2x Simplified the challenge die to a target number. Game runs on d6s only. Playtest with children and alone. Maths and selection at table are still convoluted (and might work bad for Discord games). v0.1x First version, where 3d6 + mod are rolled with a challenge die (d4 to d20). Player choose 2d6 + mod for success, 1d6 for effect. Playtest with children and alone and it felt convoluted.
