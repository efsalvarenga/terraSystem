# Terran Engine SRD v0.5.1 {-}

![](imgs/TerranEngineCover.png)

[**Terran Engine**](https://efsalvarenga.github.io/terraSystem/) is a rules light tabletop roleplaying system focused on narrative, player agency and consequences. Only 6-sided dice are used, in two tones: `Light Dice` and `Dark Dice`. A character sheet is available for [*download*](assets/TerranSheet.pdf), but any piece of paper is enough to play. You will also need some pencils and friends.


## Taxonomy {-}

- Meta game concepts, stats and currencies are marked as *italic*.
- Book references are marked in `code`, they might be accompanied by page ranges.
