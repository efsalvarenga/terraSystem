# Characters


1. Always start with a **Name** and an **Archetype**.
2. Roll for **Attributes**.
3. Calculate **HP** (hit points) and **Ego**.
4. Choose one **Advancement**.

## Archetypes

You are defined by an **Archetype**, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative. Each **Archetype** should offer an immediate grasp your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial **Archetypes** towards unique narratives.

The specific scenario you play might have a list of **Archetypes**.


## Attributes

You have four **Attributes**.

- **Strength**: physical power, endurance and might.
- **Dexterity**: agility, precision and physical sagacity.
- **Insight**: reasoning, understanding and empathy. 
- **Resolve**: command, determination and personality heft.

To determine **Attribute** values, roll **2d** for each, take the highest, and consult the table below. After rolling, you may swap two values.

| Highest Die    | 1-3 | 4-5 |  6  |
| -------------- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Stat Value** |  0  |  1  |  2  |

Your **Attributes** determine the size of your **Dice Pools** when you are doing something that you are capable of, and have appropriate the equipment.

In certain conditions, you might lose **Attributes**. **Attribute** loss is permanent and when any attribute goes below 0 you die.

### Skills

The specific scenario you play might have a list of **Skills**. These skills might be hierarchically related to **Attributes**. **Skills** are added to **Attribute Dice Pools**.

**Skill**-based scenarios are generally more complex for the Players.

## HP and Ego

You have two measures of survival: **HP** (hit points) and **Ego**.

**HP** (hit points) represent your health, physical disposition and endurance. You lose **HP** when you are physically harmed. To define your starting maximum **HP**, sum your **Strength** and **Dexterity**, and add 6. **HP** increase as you develop.

The base rate of recovery is 1 **HP** per day. If you are being attended by someone, recover an addition **HP**.

When your **HP** reaches 0 you lose one **Attribute** of your choice. You are unconscious and wake up with 1 **HP** after the scene ends. **Attribute** loss is permanent and when any attribute goes below 0 you die.

**Ego** combines willpower, sanity and humanity. It might be spent when you push yourself in a risky situation or use some character **Advancements**. To determine your character's starting maximum **Ego**, sum your **Insight** and **Resolve**, and add 3. **Ego** can never be higher than 6.

 **Ego** does not recover with rest or care, but by taking a **Condition**. When you take a **Condition** your **Ego** recovers to its maximum.

When your **Ego** reaches 0 you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes.

## Advancements

Every time PCs accumulate 8 XP, they gain an **Advancement**. Alongside an **Advancement**, a PC also gains +1 maximum **HP** and +1 maximum **Ego**.


- **Extra Attribute**: Gain +1 in one chosen **Attribute**. **Attribute** maximum is 2 in the first 10 advancements and 3 thereafter.

## Risky Actions

When you attempt a **Risky Action**, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate **Attribute**. Then gather 6-sided dice.

| Colour         | Dice Pool                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Light Dice** | Take your appropriate **Attribute** (modified by **Skills**, if applicable) **Dice Pool**. If you don’t have any relevant **Attribute Dice Pool**, then you cannot take **Light Dice**. You can never take more than 4 **Light Dice**. |
| **Dark Dice**  | Add as many **Dark Dice** as you wish to risk **Ego** for a desperate success.                                                                                                                                                         |

Roll the dice.

| Highest Die | Outcome                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3         | You fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe how it goes wrong. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. |
| 4-5         | You succeed, but there’s some kind of complication. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed.                                             |
| 6           | You succeed. With the GM describe what happens.                                                                                                            |

For each **Dark Dice** that is equal or higher than your current Ego, decrease your **Ego** in one.

If the **Risky Action** is part of a longer **Challenge**, roll **Effects** as appropriate.

## Challenges

Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome **Challenges**. Examples of **Challenges** are

- a fighting enemy,
- a rhetoric duel,
- an environment to be negotiated with,
- a location crawl,
- a journey.

**Challenges** have **Disposition**, which measures how much **Effect** they takes to be overcame. **Armours** do not modify **Effects** applied to a **Challenge's Disposition**, like they do for your **HP**. **Challenges** may also have their own **Effect Dice**, that are applied to you as consequences of your **Risky Actions**.

| Challenge Level | Disposition | Effect Dice | Examples                                                              |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trivial         | 1           | **d3**      | Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey                |
| Dangerous       | 5           | **1d**      | Skilled adversaries, small explosions, troublesome journey            |
| Serious         | 10          | **2d**      | Expert adversareis, predator, close contact with fire or acid         |
| Formidable      | 15          | **3d**      | Human prime, apex predator, immersion in acid, large explosions       |
| Extreme         | 20          | **4d**      | Transhuman, often fatal environments, most difficult journey possible |

If multiple challenges gang up against you, increase the **Challenge Level** in one for each two additional challenges after the first.

Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous **Challenge** to fight against, but a Trivial **Challenge** to be convinced to ignore you.

Note that Trivial Challenges are nothing more than a single **Risky Action**.

## Effects

**Effects** determines the quantitative result of your **Risky Actions** towards overcoming a longer **Challenge**. Examples of Effects are

- Damage given,
- Convincing done,
- Distance covered.

When you roll **Effect Dice**, only the highest result is relevant. This highest die is exploding (every time the result is a natural 6, re-roll and accumulate the result).

Different tools may modify the **Effect Dice** rolled. Examples for weapons are

| Weapon type   | Effect Die | Details                                                                           |
| ------------- | :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light melee   |  **1d3**   | Apply **Effect** before your rival                                                |
| Medium melee  |  **1d6**   | **Effect Die** is read as **1d6+1** when held with both hands                     |
| Heavy melee   |  **2d6**   | Apply **Effect** after your rival<br>Two handed                                   |
| Light ranged  |  **1d6**   |                                                                                   |
| Medium ranged | **1d6+2**  | Effect Die is **2d6** when expend all ammo (needs reloading).<br>Two handed       |
| Heavy ranged  |   **2d**   | One action to ready before every shot gives **Light Dice Pool +1d**<br>Two handed |
| Improvised    |  **1d3**   | **Light Dice Pool -1d** (not appropriate tool)                                    |

Physical harm **Effects** applied to you impacts your **HP**. The armour you wear modifies the **Effect**. Subtract the modified **Effect** from your **HP**. 

| Armour type | Retribution modifier | Details                                                      |
| ----------- | :------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Light       |          -1          |                                                              |
| Heavy       |          -2          | Disadvantageous (**-1d**) to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. |
| Shield      |          -1          | Can be sacrificed to completely avoid the **Effect**.        |
Sometimes **Challenge Effects** forks into new **Challenges**. These might be an encounter, an unexpected detour or some unlucky event. Consult the **Challenge** fork table.

| Effect Roll        |   1-3   |    4-5    |  7-11   |    13+     |
| ------------------ | :-----: | :-------: | :-----: | :--------: |
| **Challenge** fork | Trivial | Dangerous | Serious | Formidable |
