# Characters


1. Always start with a **Name** and an **Archetype**.
2. Roll for **Attributes**.
3. Calculate **HP** (hit points) and **Ego**.
4. Choose one **Advancement**.

## Archetypes

You are defined by an **Archetype**, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative. Each **Archetype** should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial **Archetypes** towards unique narratives.

- **Hero**: Embodies courage and strength, often the protagonist fighting against the odds.
- **Mentor**: Provides guidance and wisdom, helping the hero on their journey.
- **Everyman**: Represents the common man, relatability and realism.
- **Innocent**: Embodies purity, optimism, and faith.
- **Ruler**: Exudes control, responsibility, and sovereignty.
- **Sage**: Seeks truth, knowledge, and wisdom.
- **Explorer**: Loves discovering new worlds, autonomy, and the freedom to find out who they are through exploration.
- **Outlaw**: Represents rebellion, breaking the rules, and fighting against the status quo.
- **Magician**: Transforms reality, embodies vision and imagination.
- **Lover**: Pursues connection, romance, and passion.
- **Jester**: Values joy, humor, and light-heartedness.
- **Caregiver**: Provides nurture, generosity, and compassion.

## Attributes

You have four **Attributes**.

- **Strength**: physical power, endurance and might.
- **Dexterity**: agility, precision and physical sagacity.
- **Insight**: reasoning, understanding and empathy. 
- **Resolve**: command, determination and personality heft.

To determine **Attribute** values, roll $\mathbf{2d}$ for each, take the highest, and consult the table below.

|               |  $\mathbf{1:3}$   |   $\mathbf{4:5}$    |     $\mathbf{6}$      |
| :-----------: | :---------------: | :-----------------: | :-------------------: |
| **Attribute** | $\circ\circ\circ$ | $\bullet\circ\circ$ | $\bullet\bullet\circ$ |

In certain conditions, you might lose **Attributes**. **Attribute** loss is permanent and when any attribute goes below 0 you die.

### Skills

Everyone is better at some things. Choose four specific **Skills** you are good at. These may be based on your **Archetype**. With the GM you can adapt or expand the generic list of **Skills** provided.

- **Violence**: brawl, shoot, melee, exert;
- **Exploration**: notice, sneak, pilot, navigate;
- **Social**: connect, lead, perform, talk;
- **Survival**: forage, craft, heal, tame;
- **Vocational**: admin, program, know, trade

Alternatively, the game might ignore **Skills** and focus on **Attributes** only. If that is the case, choose one **Attribute** and increase it in $\mathbf{1}$.

## HP and Ego

You have two measures of survival: **HP** (hit points) and **Ego**. These measures increase as you become more seasoned.

| HP (hit points)                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HP** represent your health, physical disposition and endurance. You lose **HP** when you are physically harmed.                                     |
| $\mathbf{\textbf{HP}_{max}=\textbf{Strength}+ \textbf{Dexterity}+5}$                                                                                  |
| The base rate of recovery is 1 **HP** per day. If you are being attended by someone, recover an addition **HP**.                                      |
| When your **HP** reaches 0 you permanently lose one **Attribute** of your choice. You are unconscious and wake up with 1 **HP** after the scene ends. |

| Ego                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ego** combines willpower, sanity and humanity. You spend it when you push yourself in a risky situation or use some character **Advancements**.        |
| $\mathbf{\textbf{Ego}_{max}=\textbf{Insight}+\textbf{Resolve}+3}$                                                                                        |
| **Ego** does not recover with rest or care, but by taking a permanent **Condition**. When you take a **Condition** your **Ego** recovers to its maximum. |
| When your **Ego** reaches 0 you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes.                                                        |
| **Ego** does not recover with rest or care, but by taking a permanent **Condition**. When you take a **Condition** your **Ego** recovers to its maximum. |
| When your **Ego** reaches 0 you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes.                                                        |

## Advancements

Once every $\mathbf{2}$ to $\mathbf{5}$ sessions, when the GM deems appropriate, you gain an **Advancement**, $\mathbf{+1} \textbf{ HP}_{max}$ and $\mathbf{+1} \textbf{ Ego}_{max}$. The list of **Advancements** below may be adapted or expanded, if necessary.

- **Extra Attribute**: Increase a chosen **Attribute** in $\mathbf{1}$.
- **Protected**: Roll **Dark Dice**. Their sum can be reduced from damage you received. Lose one **Ego** for each of them that is lower than your current **Ego**.
- **Sensory acuity**: You have $\mathbf{+1d}$ on actions related to a chosen sense.
- **Sneak attack**: You have $\mathbf{+1d}$ to attack and damage to unaware rivals.
- **Sniper**: When you spend a turn aiming you have $\mathbf{+1d}$ to attack and damage to a rival.
- **Rally**: When you rally your allies, a number equal to the number of **Dark Dice** rolled get $\mathbf{+1d}$ until the end of the scene.
- **Multi-attack**: In melee, you deal one additional instance of **Damage** for each **Dark Dice** that shows a $\mathbf{6}$.
- **Tough**: Gain one additional **HP** per **Advancement**.
- **Curse**: You bring a curse to your rivals. A number equal to the number of **Dark Dice** rolled get $\mathbf{-1d}$ until the end of the scene.

## Conditions

At any moment in the game you can recover your **Ego** back to its maximum by taking a **Condition**. The recovery of your inner strength often comes through confronting, enduring, and adapting to hardship. These trials teach you to integrate the traumas that permanently transform your self, strengthening your resilience. With the GM, determine the new **Condition** you have, and how to introduce it into the narrative.

**Conditions** are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative. The list below can be used as a starting point. With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones.

- **Fear-Driven Vigilance**: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you have $\mathbf{-1d}$.
- **Obsessive Focus**: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Gain $\mathbf{+1d}$ in one skill and $\mathbf{-1d}$ in three other skills.
- **Moral Reservations**: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Actions that go against your moral code have $\mathbf{-1d}$.
- **Compulsive Honesty**: You vow to always speak the truth.
- **Kleptomaniac**: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don't really need.
- **Battle-Scarred**: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically.
- **Protective Instinct**: You are genuinely concerned with your team's welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you have $\mathbf{-1d}$.

# Rules

## Chances

When you are trying your chances at a risky action, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate **Attribute**. Then gather 6-sided dice.

|                                          | Dice Pool                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![\|20](https://i.imgur.com/Xo6X0za.png) | Take your appropriate **Attribute** (modified by **Skills**, if applicable) **Dice Pool**. If you don’t have any relevant **Attribute Dice Pool**, then you cannot take **Light Dice**. You can never take more than 4 **Light Dice**. |
| ![\|20](https://i.imgur.com/MBw81Mp.png) | Take as many **Dark Dice** as you wish to risk **Ego** for a desperate success.                                                                                                                                                        |

Roll the dice and look for the outcome of the highest value.

|                | Outcome                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\mathbf{1:3}$ | You fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe how it goes wrong. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. |
| $\mathbf{4:5}$ | You succeed, but there’s some kind of complication. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed.                                             |
|  $\mathbf{6}$  | You succeed. With the GM describe what happens.                                                                                                            |

For each **Dark Dice** that is equal or lower than your current **Ego**, decrease your **Ego** in one.

If the **Risky Action** is part of a longer **Challenge**, roll **Effects** as appropriate.

## Challenges

Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome **Challenges**. Examples of **Challenges** are

- fighting an enemy,
- dueling rhetorically,
- negotiating an environment,
- crawling a location,
- journeying.

**Challenges** have **Disposition**, which measures how much **Effect** they take to be overcame. **Challenges** may also have their own **Effect Dice**, that are applied to you as consequences of your **Risky Actions**.

| Challenge Level |  Disposition  |      Effect       | Examples                                                                               |
| --------------- | :-----------: | :---------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trivial**     | $\mathbf{1}$  | $\mathbf{1d / 2}$ | Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey                                 |
| **Dangerous**   | $\mathbf{5}$  |   $\mathbf{1d}$   | Skilled adversaries, small explosions, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey |
| **Serious**     | $\mathbf{10}$ |   $\mathbf{2d}$   | Expert adversaries, large predator, close contact with fire or acid                    |
| **Formidable**  | $\mathbf{15}$ |   $\mathbf{3d}$   | Human prime, apex predator, immersion in acid, large explosions                        |
| **Extreme**     | $\mathbf{20}$ |   $\mathbf{4d}$   | Transhuman, often fatal environments, most difficult journeys                          |

If multiple challenges gang up against you, increase the **Challenge Level** in one for each two additional challenges after the first.

Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous **Challenge** to fight against, but a Trivial **Challenge** to be convinced to ignore you.

Note that Trivial Challenges are nothing more than a single **Risky Action**.

## Effects

**Effects** determines the quantitative result of your **Risky Actions** towards overcoming a longer **Challenge**. Examples of Effects are

- Damage given,
- Convincing done,
- Distance covered.

When you roll **Effect Dice**, only the highest result is relevant. This highest die is exploding (every time the result is a natural 6, re-roll and accumulate the result).

Different tools may modify the **Effect Dice** rolled. Examples for weapons are

| Weapon |      Effect       | Examples                                                     | Details                                        |
| ------ | :---------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Small  | $\mathbf{1d / 2}$ | Knife, staff, small revolver                                 | Improvised weapons: **Chances** $\mathbf{-1d}$ |
| Medium |   $\mathbf{1d}$   | Sword, large pistol, SMG                                     | **Effect** $\mathbf{1d+1}$ if held two handed. |
| Heavy  |   $\mathbf{2d}$   | Large axe, bastard sword, shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun | Requires two hands.                            |

Physical harm **Effects** applied to you impacts your **HP**. The armour you wear modifies the **Effect**. Subtract the modified **Effect** from your **HP**. 

**Armours** do not modify **Effects** applied to a **Challenge's Disposition**, like they do for your **HP**.

| Armour |   Modifier    | Details                                                       |
| ------ | :-----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light  | $\mathbf{-1}$ |                                                               |
| Heavy  | $\mathbf{-2}$ | **Chances** $\mathbf{-1d}$ to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. |
| Shield | $\mathbf{-1}$ | Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an **Effect**.          |
Sometimes **Challenge Effects** forks into new **Challenges**. These might be an encounter, an unexpected detour or some unlucky event. Consult the **Challenge** fork table.

| Effect Roll        |   1-3   |    4-5    |  7-11   |    13+     |
| ------------------ | :-----: | :-------: | :-----: | :--------: |
| **Challenge** fork | Trivial | Dangerous | Serious | Formidable |

# Making a Game

To make it thematically specific to the target scenario, adapt the Characters' section by changing the Archetypes used, fine tuning the Attributes and skill lists, reskinning the explanation for Ego and developing coherent Advancements and Conditions. The Rules' section can be used as is.
