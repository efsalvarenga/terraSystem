# Characters


1. Always start with a **Name** and an **Archetype**.
2. Roll for **Attributes** and choose **Skills**.
3. Calculate **HP** (hit points) and **Ego**.
4. `Optional` Choose one **Advancement** and increase your $\textbf{HP}_{max}$ in $\mathbf{1}$.

## Archetypes

You are defined by an **Archetype**, which encapsulates your background, concept and role within the narrative. Each **Archetype** should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours. It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial **Archetypes** towards unique narratives.

- **Hero**: Embodies courage and strength, often the protagonist fighting against the odds.
- **Mentor**: Provides guidance and wisdom, helping the hero on their journey.
- **Everyman**: Represents the common man, relatability and realism.
- **Innocent**: Embodies purity, optimism, and faith.
- **Ruler**: Exudes control, responsibility, and sovereignty.
- **Sage**: Seeks truth, knowledge, and wisdom.
- **Explorer**: Loves discovering new worlds, autonomy, and the freedom to find out who they are through exploration.
- **Outlaw**: Represents rebellion, breaking the rules, and fighting against the status quo.
- **Magician**: Transforms reality, embodies vision and imagination.
- **Lover**: Pursues connection, romance, and passion.
- **Jester**: Values joy, humor, and light-heartedness.
- **Caregiver**: Provides nurture, generosity, and compassion.

## Attributes

You have four **Attributes**.

- **Strength**: physical power, endurance and might.
- **Agility**: dexterity, precision and physical sagacity.
- **Insight**: perception, understanding and reasoning. 
- **Charisma**: empathy, command and personality heft.

To determine **Attribute** values, roll $\mathbf{2d}$ for each, take the highest, and consult the table below.

|               |  $\mathbf{1:3}$   |   $\mathbf{4:5}$    |     $\mathbf{6}$      |
| :-----------: | :---------------: | :-----------------: | :-------------------: |
| **Attribute** | $\circ\circ\circ$ | $\bullet\circ\circ$ | $\bullet\bullet\circ$ |

In certain conditions, you might lose **Attributes**. Permanent **Attribute** loss is never recovered.

### Skills

Everyone is better at some things. You have $\mathbf{4}$ points to assign to **Skills** you are good at. These may be based on your **Archetype**. With the GM you can adapt or expand the generic list of **Skills** provided.

- **Violence**: brawl, firearms, melee weapons, bow, etc.
- **Exploration**: perception, stealth, lockpick, pilot, navigate, etc.
- **Social**: connect, leadership, musical instruments, rhetoric, etc.
- **Survival**: forage, craft, first aid, tame, etc.
- **Vocational**: bureaucracy, computers, history, geology, trade, athletics, etc.

`Optional` The game might ignore **Skills** and focus on **Attributes** only. If that is the case, choose one **Attribute** and increase it in $\mathbf{1}$.

## HP and Ego

You have two measures of survival: **HP** (hit points) and **Ego**.

### HP (hit points)

**HP** represents your physical disposition and stamina. You lose **HP** when you are physically harmed.

$\mathbf{\textbf{HP}_{max}}$ is calculated by adding your physical **Attributes** (**Strength** and **Agility**) with $\mathbf{2}$. You gain $\mathbf{+1}\textbf{ HP}_{max}$ for each **Advancement** you have.

When your **HP** reaches $\mathbf{0}$ you become **Critically Wounded** and have $\mathbf{-1d}$ every time you are building your **Light Dice Pool**. If you take any further damage you become **Mortally Wounded**, lose $\mathbf{1}$ permanently in an **Attribute** of your choice, and have $\mathbf{-2d}$ every time you are building your **Light Dice Poo**l. While **Mortally Wounded** you are unconscious or inactive is most cases, and will die immediately if any further damage is taken.

A **Mortal Wound** becomes a **Critical Wound** through appropriate care and a week of rest. The lost **Attribute** does not recover. A **Critical Wound** recovers in a week, also given appropriate care. If you have no **Wounds**, **HP** recovers to its maximum after a well rested night.

### Ego

**Ego** represents your resolve, sanity and humanity. You spend it when you push yourself in a risky situation or use some character **Advancements**.

$\mathbf{\textbf{Ego}_{max}}$ is calculated by adding your mental **Attributes** (**Insight** and **Empathy**) with $\mathbf{2}$.

If your **Ego** reaches $\mathbf{0}$ you are lost somehow. With the GM determine how your last scene goes. At any moment you may choose to take a permanent **Condition** to recover your **Ego** to its maximum.

## Advancements

At the end of each session you get one **Experience** for each **Ego** you have lost. You can use your **Experience** to gain an **Advancement** or to develop **Skills**. Either way, decide with the GM how to carry this development out in the narrative.

|                       | Roll                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Advancement**       | Roll one die for each **Experience** you are willing to use. If the sum of your dice is equal or higher than the sum of your $\textbf{Ego}_{max}$ and $\textbf{HP}_{max}$ you gain an **Advancement** and $\mathbf{+1} \textbf{ HP}_{max}$ |
| **Skill Development** | Roll one die for each **Experience** you are willing to use. If the sum of your dice is equal of higher than $\textbf{3x}$ your current **Skill** rating, the **Skill** improves in $\textbf{1}$.                                          |

The list of **Advancements** below may be adapted or expanded, if necessary.

- **Extra Attribute**: Increase a chosen **Attribute** in $\mathbf{1}$.
- **Protected**: Roll **Dark Dice**. Their sum can be reduced from damage you received. Lose one **Ego** for each of them that is lower than your current **Ego**.
- **Sensory acuity**: You have $\mathbf{+1d}$ on actions related to a chosen sense.
- **Sneak attack**: You have $\mathbf{+1d}$ to attack and damage to unaware rivals.
- **Sniper**: When you spend a turn aiming you have $\mathbf{+1d}$ to attack and damage to a rival.
- **Rally**: When you rally your allies, a number equal to the number of **Dark Dice** rolled get $\mathbf{+1d}$ until the end of the scene.
- **Multi-attack**: In melee, you deal one additional instance of **Damage** for each **Dark Dice** that shows a $\mathbf{6}$.
- **Tough**: Gain one additional **HP** per **Advancement**.
- **Curse**: You bring a curse to your rivals. A number equal to the number of **Dark Dice** rolled get $\mathbf{-1d}$ until the end of the scene.

## Conditions

At any moment in the game you can recover your **Ego** back to its maximum by taking a **Condition**. The recovery of your inner strength often comes through confronting, enduring, and adapting to hardship. These trials teach you to integrate the traumas that permanently transform your self, strengthening your resilience. With the GM, determine the new **Condition** you have, and how to introduce it into the narrative.

**Conditions** are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative. The list below can be used as a starting point. With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones.

- **Fear-Driven Vigilance**: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you have $\mathbf{-1d}$.
- **Obsessive Focus**: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Gain $\mathbf{+1d}$ in one skill and $\mathbf{-1d}$ in three other skills.
- **Moral Reservations**: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Actions that go against your moral code have $\mathbf{-1d}$.
- **Compulsive Honesty**: You vow to always speak the truth.
- **Kleptomaniac**: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don't really need.
- **Battle-Scarred**: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically.
- **Protective Instinct**: You are genuinely concerned with your team's welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you have $\mathbf{-1d}$.
- **Estranged**: You lose the bond with someone you love or cherish, $\textbf{Ego}_{max} - 1$.

# Rules

## Risky Actions

When you are trying your chances at a **Risky Action**, say what you intend to do. With the GM determine your appropriate **Attribute** (and **Skill**, if applicable). Then gather 6-sided dice.

|                                | Dice Pool                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :----------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](imgs/dice-light-6-sml.png) | Take a number of **Light Dice** equal to your **Attribute** (and **Skill**, if applicable). If you are in an advantageous or precarious position, the GM may give you $\mathbf{\pm 1d}$. You must always have between $\mathbf{0}$ and $\mathbf{4}$ **Light Dice**. |
| ![](imgs/dice-dark-6-sml.png)  | Take as many **Dark Dice** as you wish to risk **Ego** for pushing yourself for a success. For each **Dark Dice** that rolls equal or lower than your current **Ego**, decrease your **Ego** in one.                                                                |


Roll the dice and look for the outcome of the highest value. 

|                | Outcome                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\mathbf{1:3}$ | You fail, and things get worse. With the GM describe how it goes wrong. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. |
| $\mathbf{4:5}$ | You succeed, but there’s some kind of complication. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed.                                             |
|  $\mathbf{6}$  | You succeed. With the GM describe what happens.                                                                                                            |
If the **Risky Action** is part of a longer **Challenge**, roll **Effects** as appropriate.

## Challenges

Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome **Challenges**. Examples of **Challenges** are

- fighting an enemy,
- dueling rhetorically,
- negotiating an environment,
- crawling a location,
- journeying.

**Challenges** have **Disposition**, which measures how much **Effect** they take to be overcame. **Challenges** also have **Effect Dice** that are applied to you as consequences of your **Risky Actions**.

| Challenge Level |  Disposition   |     Effect     | Examples                                                                               |
| --------------- | :------------: | :------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trivial**     |  $\mathbf{5}$  | $\mathbf{d/2}$ | Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey                                 |
| **Dangerous**   | $\mathbf{10}$  | $\mathbf{1d}$  | Skilled adversaries, small explosions, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey |
| **Serious**     | $\mathbf{20}$  | $\mathbf{2d}$  | Expert adversaries, large predator, close contact with fire or acid                    |
| **Formidable**  | $\mathbf{30}$  | $\mathbf{3d}$  | Human prime, apex predator, immersion in acid, large explosions                        |
| **Extreme**     | $\mathbf{40}$  | $\mathbf{4d}$  | Transhuman, often fatal environments, most difficult journeys                          |
| **Fantastical** | $\mathbf{10n}$ | $\mathbf{nd}$  | Anything...                                                                            |

If multiple challenges gang up against you, increase the **Challenge Level** in one for each two additional challenges after the first.

Some challenges might be multifaceted. A bulky rival might be a Dangerous **Challenge** to fight against, but a Trivial **Challenge** to be convinced to ignore you.

### Effects

**Effects** determines the quantitative result of your **Risky Actions** towards overcoming a longer **Challenge**. Examples of Effects are

- Damage given,
- Convincing done,
- Distance covered.

When you roll **Effect Dice**, only the highest result is relevant. This highest die is exploding (every time the result is a natural 6, re-roll and accumulate the result).

Different tools may modify the **Effect Dice** rolled.

| Equipment                         |      Effect      | Examples                                                                            | Details                                           |
| --------------------------------- | :--------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lesser tool;<br>Small weapon**  | $\mathbf{d / 2}$ | Primitive tool;<br>Knife, staff, small revolver                                     | Improvised tools: **Risky Action** $\mathbf{-1d}$ |
| **Normal tool;<br>Medium weapon** |  $\mathbf{1d}$   | Fit for purpose tool;<br>Sword, large pistol, SMG                                   | **Effect** $\mathbf{1d+1}$ if held two handed.    |
| **Greater tool;<br>Large weapon** |  $\mathbf{2d}$   | Expert grade tool;<br>Large axe, bastard sword, shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun; | Requires two hands.                               |

Physical harm **Effects** applied to you impacts your **HP**, and **Attributes** when you reach $\mathbf{0}$ **HP**. The armour you wear modifies the **Effect**. Subtract the modified **Effect** from your **HP** or **Attributes**.

**Armours** do not modify **Effects** applied to a **Challenge's Disposition**, like they do for you.

| Armour     |   Modifier    | Details                                                       |
| ---------- | :-----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Light**  | $\mathbf{-1}$ |                                                               |
| **Heavy**  | $\mathbf{-2}$ | **Chances** $\mathbf{-1d}$ to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc. |
| **Shield** | $\mathbf{-1}$ | Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an **Effect**.          |

Sometimes **Challenge Effects** forks into new **Challenges** or complications on the current **Challenge**. Extra **Challenges** might be an encounter, an unexpected detour, a hidden threat or some unlucky event. Complications, on the other hand, pose some additional difficulty on the next **Risky Action** roll related to the **Challenge**.

| Effect Roll      |     1-3      |      4-5       |      7-11      |      13+       |
| ---------------- | :----------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| **Challenge**    |   Trivial    |   Dangerous    |    Serious     |   Formidable   |
| **Complication** | $\mathbf{-}$ | $\mathbf{-1d}$ | $\mathbf{-2d}$ | $\mathbf{-3d}$ |
### Montage

You and the GM might prefer to resolve a **Challenge** in one single roll. That is possible by rolling the **Challenge Effect** prior to gathering your **Dice Pool**. Apply the Complication modifier to your **Dice Pool** and roll your **Risky Action**. You risk $\mathbf{2}$ **Ego** for each **Dark Die** you use. Your companions can also pool their **Ego** to help you. This single roll determine the outcome of the entire **Challenge**.

It is not recommended to use **Montages** if the consequence of failure would be the death of someone. On those cases, playing the Challenge as a longer one gives more manoeuvre space.

## Fortune die

When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, define the chances and roll $\mathbf{1d}$.

# Making a Game

To make **Terran Engine** thematically specific to the target scenario, adapt the Characters' section by changing the **Archetypes** used, fine tuning the **Attributes** and **Skill** lists, reskinning the explanation for **Ego** and developing coherent **Advancements** and **Conditions**. The Rules' section can be used as is.
