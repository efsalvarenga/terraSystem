# Making a Game

**Terran Engine** is focuses on the grimdark aesthetics, which might not be the thematic choice of every game.

By adapting the *Archetypes* and *Advancements*, and reskinning *Ego* (and *Conditions*), other genres can easily be emulated. A few playtested examples are given. The Rules section can mostly be used as is.

## Ego in Pulp Fantasy

For the Pulp Fantasy genre, Ego can be used as a measure of how far the next climax is. Whenever relevant, the GM rolls one die. If the die is higher than the highest Ego of the Party, a climax event happens. After this climax, all Ego is restored to its original max.

- Long term conditions (drama)
- Short term stress (horror)
- Mutations
