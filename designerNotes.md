## Design Principles



## Designer Notes

- Statistics between PbtA games [2d6 + Stat Vs. Dice Pools](https://troypress.com/probabilities-of-2d6-compared-to-d6-dice-pools/)
- Skilled Challenge has 1d Effect. For same chances for Players, skilled characters should have 1.88 dice in the pool. Unskilled should have 0.81 dice in the pool.
- Skilled at 1/6 of tasks: 1 average dice pool at character creation.

Success: (2, 75); (1, 50) -> y = 25x + 25
Consequence: (2, 69); (1, 83) -> y = -14x + 97


And so I design Cthulhu Dark. I’m inspired by the simple-but-beautiful die mechanics of Ron Edwards’ Sorcerer. When you want to do something in Cthulhu Dark, you roll one die if what you’re doing is within human capabilities, one die if your occupation is relevant and one die if you risk your mind to succeed. The highest die tells you how well you do.

Damage Monsters normally deal damage equal to their Hit Die. If an attack causes a diff erent amount of damage, this should be listed in the attack’s description. Disposition A monster’s Disposition score is determined by rolling its Hit Die one or more times, based on its size and what condition it is currently in: • Tiny, weak, or unwell creatures roll one Hit Die to determine their Disposition score. • Sturdy and well-rested creatures roll two Hit Dice and use the total for their Disposition score. • Huge creatures, and those that are supernaturally durable, roll three Hit Dice and use the total for their Disposition score.

- how does sneak attacks / surprise / aim works with regards to Advancements? Are they moves only available when the PC has the said advancement?
- attribute loss is temporary, and recovers 1 per week (not necessarily rest)
- if an attribute goes to -1, the PC is unconscious. The pc wakes up with 1 hp in the end of the scene.
- Ego:
	- consider some creatures damaging ego (despair attack)
	- consider recovering ego in a rate of 1 or 2 per week, based on Relations rule
- Add relations rule
- mention what has to be diagetic in the game

- Critical effects (e g. high damage) happens more often for higher skilled characters.

HARD
EDGE
WILL


Certainly! Here's a description of your challenge subsystem concept for a tabletop RPG:

---

In the proposed challenge subsystem for the tabletop RPG, each challenge presented to the characters is evaluated across three distinct axes: HARD, EDGE, and WILL. The HARD axis gauges the challenge's demand on the characters' physical hardiness and endurance, testing their ability to withstand and overcome physically taxing situations. The EDGE axis measures the challenge against characters' intellectual sharpness, technological prowess, and problem-solving skills, emphasizing the necessity for clever thinking and the application of sophisticated tools or techniques. Finally, the WILL axis assesses the mental resilience required to face the challenge, focusing on the characters' willpower, determination, and psychological fortitude. This tri-axial approach allows for a nuanced and comprehensive assessment of challenges, ensuring that players must engage a variety of character strengths to succeed.

Certainly! Here are a few more examples of how challenges might be classified within this subsystem, spanning various levels and dimensions:

1. **Goblin Ambush**:
   - **Challenge Level:** 6
   - **HARD:** 2
   - **EDGE:** 1
   - **WILL:** 3
   - **Description:** A small group of goblins lay in wait, testing the party's ability to handle a sudden physical threat, quick tactical decision-making, and the fear of being outnumbered.

2. **Deciphering Ancient Runes**:
   - **Challenge Level:** 9
   - **HARD:** 1
   - **EDGE:** 6
   - **WILL:** 2
   - **Description:** The characters must translate complex runes in an ancient tome, requiring minimal physical effort but significant intellectual capability and some determination against the frustration of arcane languages.

3. **Crossing a Raging River**:
   - **Challenge Level:** 12
   - **HARD:** 6
   - **EDGE:** 3
   - **WILL:** 3
   - **Description:** The party must find a way to cross a swift and dangerous river, challenging their physical robustness, use of practical skills or devices to navigate or construct a means to cross, and their resolve to overcome the fear and risk of drowning.

4. **Resisting a Powerful Illusion**:
   - **Challenge Level:** 15
   - **HARD:** 3
   - **EDGE:** 4
   - **WILL:** 8
   - **Description:** An enchanting illusion threatens to lead the party astray. They must rely moderately on their physical senses, significantly on their mental acuity to discern the illusion, and heavily on their willpower to resist its allure.

5. **Surviving a Desert Trek**:
   - **Challenge Level:** 18
   - **HARD:** 8
   - **EDGE:** 3
   - **WILL:** 7
   - **Description:** The harsh conditions of a desert test the party’s endurance against extreme heat and dehydration, their use of survival technology or techniques to navigate and sustain themselves, and their mental grit to keep moving towards their goal under duress.

These examples provide a range of scenarios, from physical confrontations and environmental hazards to intellectual and psychological tests, showcasing how the challenge subsystem can be applied across a broad spectrum of adventures.

Original: HP + Ego
To 1: 8
To 2: 9
To 3: 10
To 4: 12

New: Attr + Adv
To 1: 4x2
To 2: (4+1) x2 = 10
To 3: (4+2) x2 = 12
To 4: (5+3) x2 = 16


- BitD starts with E(d) = .78, and has push rolls and devils bargains
- Kult (converted to dice pool) starts with E(d) = 1.35 (active) and 1.65 (passive) without push rolls or devils bargains 
- Trophy starts with E(d) = . (4 skills), and has push rolls and devils bargains 

Because terran Engine has push rolls but no devils bargains, E(d) = 1 is good. Especially because it is aligned with BLB.

For non-skill games, roll 2d and get highest based on table.
