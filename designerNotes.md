## Designer Notes

- Statistics between PbtA games [2d6 + Stat Vs. Dice Pools](https://troypress.com/probabilities-of-2d6-compared-to-d6-dice-pools/)
- Skilled Challenge has 1d Effect. For same chances for Players, skilled characters should have 1.88 dice in the pool. Unskilled should have 0.81 dice in the pool.
- Skilled at 1/6 of tasks: 1 average dice pool at character creation.

Success: (2, 75); (1, 50) -> y = 25x + 25
Consequence: (2, 69); (1, 83) -> y = -14x + 97


And so I design Cthulhu Dark. I’m inspired by the simple-but-beautiful die mechanics of Ron Edwards’ Sorcerer. When you want to do something in Cthulhu Dark, you roll one die if what you’re doing is within human capabilities, one die if your occupation is relevant and one die if you risk your mind to succeed. The highest die tells you how well you do.
